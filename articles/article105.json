    "text": "Twenty-two months after completing its $67 billion megadeal to ingest EMC Corp., Dell Technologies has again gone public with the issuance of a publicly traded tracking stock and the buyout of earlier investors in the EMC deal. The complex transaction allows founder Michael Dell and financial partner Silver Lake to maintain majority control of the IT giant.Michael Dell and Silver Lake partnered in 2013 to take the company private in a transaction valued at about $25 billion.In its return to public trading, Dell announced it would exchange common stock for a tracking stock created to finance its September 2016 acquisition of EMC and most of VMware. The $21.7 billion deal announced Monday (July 2) is designed to buy back shares created in 2016 to acquire EMC.Dell\u00a0(NYSE: DVMT) said holders of the tracking stock, which paralleled Dell\u2019s stake in VMware, would receive either common stock in Dell or cash. The tracking stock would then be eliminated.Michael Dell owns 72 percent of Dell Technologies\u2019 common stock while Silver Lake currently holds 24 percent.The transaction \u201csimplifies capital structure and positions Dell Technologies to build on its growing strategic and financial strength,\u201d the company said. Dell will retain an 81 percent stake in VMware, which remains a separate publicly traded company.\u201cUnprecedented data growth is fueling the digital era of IT, and we are uniquely positioned with our portfolio of technologies and services to enable the digital, IT, security and workforce transformations of our customers,\u201d Dell\u2019s chairman and CEO said.Dell \u201cdid what it had to do as a private company that would have been more difficult as a public one,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. Those steps included shedding its legacy services and software units along with its acquisition of storage leader EMC\u00a0 and its majority stake in VMware.\u201cThe equity markets are on fire now and given state the company's turnaround, it makes a lot of sense to me,\u201d Moorhead added.Analysts also noted that Dell\u2019s portfolio, which along with EMC and VMware includes cloud services provider Pivotal Software, RSA, Secureworks and Virtustream, positions the IT giant in market segments ranging from the Internet of Things and edge computing to AI and networking technology.Dell also remains the leading global server vendor. Moorhead said the publicly traded company also is well positioned in booming markets like storage and analytics, networking infrastructure and, eventually, machine learning.Aside from the return to public trading, observers foresee few changes in how Dell Technologies operates, noting that no new management changes were announced. Michael Dell will continue to own between 47 percent and 54 percent of the company, Moorhead estimated.For its part, the company noted: \u201cAs a public company, Dell Technologies has maintained and plans to continue to maintain the same strategic focus on long-term growth that the company had achieved while being privately managed.\u201dDell Technologies\u2019 common stock\u00a0has been trending sharply higher since the transaction was announced on Monday.George Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
