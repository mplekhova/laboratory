    "text": "Tabor Communications, publisher of high performance technology publications HPCwire, Datanami and EnterpriseTech, has announced that EnterpriseTech has been re-branded as EnterpriseAI. The new name reflects the publication\u2019s increased focus on AI in recent years and increased interest in AI, machine learning, deep learning, robotics and other AI-related technologies among enterprise IT strategists.\u201cEnterpriseTech, focused since its founding on enterprise adoption of advanced scale technologies developed by the HPC and open source communities, has closely covered AI technology and AI implementation strategies in recent years \u2013 the change to EnterpriseAI expresses our intent to further sharpen and build upon the publication\u2019s AI focus,\u201d said Tom Tabor, publisher. \u201cThere\u2019s enormous demand from IT strategists for news and insight about AI trends and technologies. Our intent is to make EnterpriseAI an indispensable meeting ground for information, analysis and discussion for those who develop and use AI.\u201dEnterpriseAI defines \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d broadly to include all the technologies \u2013 machine and deep learning, cognitive computing, bots, robotics, industrial automation and AI silicon \u2013 that support previously unattainable analytics, automation, autonomous and simulation workloads. The publication also will cover new computing strategies used in distributed AI implementations, including IoT, blockchain and edge-core-cloud infrastructures.EnterpriseAI takes its place alongside Tabor Communications\u2019 portfolio of publications which, since 1988, have formed an advanced computing nexus, including flagship publication HPCwire covering supercomputing and HPC technologies, and the widely read Datanami covering software, data management and application aspects of big data, high performance data analytics and AI. Along with EnterpriseAI, this three-pronged source of information delivers a broad, holistic perspective on advanced technologies\u2019 impact across the scientific and industrial landscapes.In recent years, as organizations have embraced more complex near/real-time analytics, this publication has put more emphasis on accelerated investment in AI technology and technical expertise. Among our readers and our conference attendees (at Tabor\u2019s Advanced Scale Forum, HPC & AI on Wall Street), there is greater interest in AI-related capabilities \u2013 from predictive analytics for customer behavior, weather forecasts, energy consumption, equipment maintenance and market sizing; to faster and more accurate seismic exploration; to breakthrough innovations, efficiencies and quality in product design and manufacturing. AI is at the apex of advanced-scale enterprise technology trends that have been in place for decades: it\u2019s is at the convergence of increasingly powerful compute, the data deluge, accelerated networks and advanced algorithms.EnterpriseAI covers enterprise AI in its most advanced form as well as in the broader market level. At the \u201chigh end,\u201d the publication will cover AI technologies and implementations adopted by the most resource-rich organizations in the web-scale, hyperscale, financial services, retail and other industries seeking critical competitive advantage attainable from leading-edge, customized AI implementations.At the AI \u201cmid-level\u201d market, EnterpriseAI will pay attention to AI democratization trends: technologies and techniques for simplifying and automating aspects of AI that currently require teams of computer/data scientists typically lacking in the broader enterprise market. \u00a0EnterpriseAI will aim to de-mystify AI, to open the \u201cblack box\u201d and examine practical, adoptable deployment strategies \u2013 how organizations are deriving insight from expanding, mixed-format volumes of data with algorithm-driven learning systems that use circular, enriching data loops to continually improve at a given task. A rapidly expanding ecosystem of established and start-up technology vendors are putting their full weight behind AI democratization. EnterpriseAI will provide insight into how those technologies are incorporated into organizations\u2019 AI strategies.Also within the publication\u2019s scope are off-prem (cloud and colo) offerings placing extensive data center infrastructure requirements for AI within the reach of more organizations.",
