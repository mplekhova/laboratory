    "title": "Merger Complete, Dell Rolls Automated IT",
    "text": "Dell Technologies this week rolled out its data-driven vision of the automated IT infrastructure for the next decade, signaling in the process that it has completed the integration of among the largest technology mergers in history.Emphasizing the \u201cnext decade of data\u201d generated by networked platforms and ever-increasing computing power, Michael Dell said the next step is consolidating infrastructure to integrate and secure data.The company\u2019s (NYSE: DELL) new automated IT infrastructure seeks to take \u201cthat data and move it to the appropriate resource or application, in a public cloud or an on-premise cloud, [software-as-a-service] cloud and we can analyze it and act on it with agility,\u201d Dell said.Moving data across increasingly fragmented infrastructure, Michael Dell added, was the idea behind merging the company he founded with storage giant EMC, VMware (NYSE: VMW) and cloud software specialist Pivotal to form Dell Technologies.The challenge is siloed infrastructure, exacerbated by the shift to edge computing and distributed infrastructures. Machine learning, for example, won\u2019t work if data sources are fragmentated. Without data integration, Dell asserted, \u201cIt\u2019s all noise.\u201dThe next decade will be \u201cfundamentally smart everything\u201d with data flowing across entire systems, added John Roese Dell Technologies\u2019 president and CTO for products and operations.Dell\u2019s response is an automated infrastructure, a \u201cmulti-cloud operational hub,\u201d dubbed PowerOne. Unveiled this week, Dell\u2019s platform assumes computing, storage and networking will scale and become cheaper. The limiting factor is \u201chuman capacity in the system,\u201d Roese said, confronting the current \u201cinability to scale the human capacity\u201d bogged down in IT tasks that could be automated.\u201cWe need a multi-cloud operational hub so we can orchestrate and automate the multi-cloud world,\u201d Roese said, then apply AI-driven automation and data security across enterprise infrastructure.Hence, PowerOne is touted as a combining Dell\u2019s infrastructure offerings into an \u201call-in-one automated\u201d platform providing \u201cpools\u201d of computing, storage and networking that can be allocated via APIs. The PowerOne \u201ccontroller,\u201d or automation engine, represents the brains of the automated IT platform, coordinating resources using what Dell calls \u201copinionated automation\u201d to deploy IT capacity pools to software stacks such as virtualized servers.The appliance uses Kubernetes orchestration to automate the configuration and provisioning of resources. For example, the cluster orchestrator has been integrated with VMware\u2019s vSphere server virtualization software. The controller runs on top of Dell EMC switches, storage arrays and data security features.The result, Dell claims, is a 98-percent reduction in manual IT tasks. For example, spinning up a VMware cluster could be reduced to several clicks, Roese said.Along with providing an automated hub, Dell also touts its new IT architecture as an example of how it has integrated EMC storage and VMware\u2019s virtualization technologies into a flagship platform aimed at data-driven applications.The company has also joined the growing list of infrastructure providers offering on-demand infrastructure services across multi-cloud deployments.Ultimately, Roese added, the IT automation platform seeks \u201cto improve the ratio of people to IT capacity. That\u2019s the challenge.\u201dAnother was completing the blockbuster Dell-EMC merger. \u201cWe\u2019ve stabilized the business over the last two years,\u201d noted Jeff Clarke, Dell Technologies\u2019 vice chairman. \u201cWe\u2019ve established a collaboration model\u2026 with VMware that now works across\u201d the merged companyDell Technologies said its PowerOne IT automation platform will be available on Nov. 22.George Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
