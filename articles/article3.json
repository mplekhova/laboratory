We will continue to update the article as the status of conferences changes.Several conferences scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, including Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) and the Strata Data + AI conference, have been canceled due to fears of the COVID-19 coronavirus. Many of these events have been transformed to online, or virtual, events to stem the spread of the contagious virus. The Gartner Data and Analytics Summit, however, is still scheduled to take place later this month.\u201cAs the coronavirus situation is not improving, we\u2019re turning GTC San Jose into a digital conference rather than a live event,\u201d an\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0spokesperson wrote in an email today to journalists planning on covering the event. \u201cJensen [Huang, the CEO] will still give a keynote. We will still share our announcements. And we\u2019ll work to ensure our speakers can share their talks. But we\u2019ll do this all online.\u201dNvidia will issue full refunds to folks who purchased admission to the event, which was scheduled to take place March 23 \u2013 March 26 at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center.On February 28, the\u00a0Open Compute Project Foundation\u00a0canceled the OCP Global Summit, which had been scheduled to start on March 3 at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. It has been rescheduled as a virtual event for the week of May 11. The organization issued the following statement:\u201cDue to the fact that the World Health Organization today increased the assessment of the risk of spread and impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level, and additional cases reported in key regions including Santa Clara County (California), the Open Compute Project Foundation has decided to cancel the OCP Global Summit next week.\u201d The cancelation also covers two related events, the Future Technology Symposium and the Open System Firmware Hack event.The analytics firm\u00a0Domo\u00a0similarly cancelled the upcoming Domopalooza 2020 event, which had been scheduled to take place March 18 and March 19 in Salt Lake City, Utah. \u201c\u2026[I]n taking steps to minimize the risk of COVID-19, we\u2019re transforming Domopalooza 2020 into an event that is 100% online,\u201d the company said. The keynotes, general sessions, customer stories, and breakout sessions will all be accessed over the Internet.Adobe\u00a0has also cancelled its physical Adobe Summit event, scheduled for March 29 \u2013 April 2 in Las Vegas, Nevada, and has transformed it into a virtual event. \u201cOver the past few weeks, we have been closely monitoring and evaluating the situation around COVID-19 to ensure we are taking the necessary measures to protect the health and well-being of Adobe Summit attendees,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cAs a result, we have made the difficult but important decision to make Adobe Summit 2020 an online event this year and to cancel the live event in Las Vegas.\u201dGoogle Cloud also canceled its upcoming event, Google Cloud Next \u201920, which was slated to take place April 6 -8 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. \u201cDue to the growing concern around the coronavirus (COVID-19), and in alignment with the best practices laid out by the CDC, WHO and other relevant entities, Google Cloud has decided to reimagine Google Cloud Next \u201920,\u201d the company\u00a0states on its website.Microsoft has also canceled the physical Microsoft MVP Global Summit, scheduled for March 15 \u2013\u00a0 March 20 in the Redmond, Washington area and made it an online-only affair.Tabor Communications, the parent company of\u00a0Datanami, has postponed the\u00a0HPC & AI on Wall Street\u00a0event that was scheduled to take place in Singapore on April 14 and 15. It has been rescheduled for 2021. The HPC & AI on Wall Street New York event is scheduled to take place September 14 and 15.\u201cWe made the decision to reschedule our Singapore event in late February, nearly 60 days before its scheduled date,\u201d Tabor Communications CEO Tom Tabor says. \u201cWe were closely monitoring the developments of the virus and realized the upward trend of this situation was not slowing in the APAC geo.

But an abundance of caution and our belief in putting people first has shifted our resolve.\"The Gartner Data and Analytics Summit, which is scheduled to take place March 23 \u2013 26 near Dallas, Texas, is still going ahead too. \u201cWe are closely monitoring and assessing new developments pertaining to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), including World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and regional and national government directives and guidance,\u201d the company states on\u00a0its conference website.Flink Forward North America will also go ahead as planned in San Francisco from March 23 through 25.\u00a0Ververica, the company behind the Apache Flink data streaming framework, expects more than 500 people to attend the event, which will take place at the Hyatt Regency hotel.\u00a0Enterprise Data World\u00a0is also planning to host more than 1,000 people at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina in San Diego from March 22 to 27. \u00a0The analytics company\u00a0SAS\u00a0is also planning to go ahead with its SAS Global Forum from March 29 to April 1 in Washington, DC.Dell has elected to go ahead with the Dell Technologies HPC Community Meeting, which is scheduled for March 9-12 in Austin, Texas. \u201cDell Technologies HPC Community Meeting and the COVID-19 outbreak. \u201cDell Technologies is closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and has instituted some precautionary policies on international travel,\u201d write the event coordinators, Jay Boisseau and Janet Morss. \u201cWe understand and respect cautionary decisions by other, larger conferences with 10K-100K international attendees to postpone (Game Developers Conference), go digital (GTC) or cancel (Mobile World Congress).\u00a0 However, the situation in Austin, and in Texas, is\u00a0currently\u00a0100% business-as-usual. We are watching things closely\u2026\u201dNeo4j\u00a0has made no announcement regarding changes to its upcoming\u00a0GraphConnect\u00a0event, which is scheduled to take place April 20-22 in New York.
