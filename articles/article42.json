    "text": "Applied Materials, the $17 billion Santa Clara-based materials engineering company for the semiconductor industry, today announced manufacturing systems enabling new memory technologies to be deposited \u201cwith atomic-level precision\u201d within chips.\u201cToday\u2019s high-volume memory technologies including DRAM, SRAM and flash were invented decades ago and have become ubiquitous in digital devices and systems,\u201d said the company. \u201cNew memories \u2013 notably MRAM, ReRAM and PCRAM \u2013 promise unique benefits, but they are based on new materials that have been too challenging for high-volume manufacturing\u2026 The company is delivering the most advanced systems it has ever developed to enable these promising new memories to be reliably produced at an industrial scale.\u201dApplied Materials\u2019 Endura platforms allow integration of multiple materials engineering technologies along with on-board metrology to create new films and structures that the company said were not previously possible. \u201cThese integrated platforms illustrate the critical role that new materials and 3D architectures can play in giving the computing industry entirely new ways to improve performance, power and cost,\u201d said Dr. Prabu Raja, SVP/GM of Applied\u2019s Semiconductor Products Group.Applied\u2019s Endura Clover MRAM (magnetic random access memory, which incorporates magnetic materials found in hard disk drives and is a memory of choice for IoT devices) PVD platform is comprised of nine wafer processing chambers integrated in high-vacuum conditions, the company said, a 300-millimeter MRAM system for high-volume manufacturing for individually depositing up to five materials per chamber.\u201cMRAM memories require precise deposition of at least 30 different layers of material, some of which are 500,000 times thinner than a human hair,\u201d the company said. \u201cProcess variations of just a fraction of the diameter of an atom can greatly affect device performance and reliability. The Clover MRAM PVD platform includes on-board metrology that measures and monitors thickness of the MRAM layers with sub-angstrom sensitivity as they are created, to ensure atomic-level uniformity without risking exposure to the outside environment.\u201d\u201cAs an extremely fast, high-endurance nonvolatile memory, MRAM is poised to displace embedded flash and level 3 cache SRAM in both IoT and AI applications,\u201d said Tom Sparkman, CEO of Spin Memory. \u201cThe availability of a high-volume manufacturing system from Applied Materials is a huge boost to the ecosystem, and we are thrilled to be working with Applied to deliver MRAM solutions and accelerate its adoption.\u201dApplied said its Endura Impulse PVD platform for PCRAM and ReRAM includes up to nine process chambers integrated under vacuum along with on-board metrology for deposition and control of the multicomponent materials used emerging memories.\u201cAs data generation grows exponentially, cloud data centers require order-of-magnitude improvements in the speed and power consumption of the data pathways linking servers and storage systems,\u201d the company said. \u201cReRAM (resistive RAM) and PCRAM (phase change RAM) are fast, nonvolatile, low-power, high-density memories that can be used as \u2018storage class memory\u2019 to fill the widening price-performance gap between server DRAM and storage.\u201dApplied said ReRAM and PCRAM has the potential to deliver lower cost than DRAM and faster read performance than NAND and hard disk drives. \u201cReRAM is also a leading candidate for future in-memory computing architectures whereby computing elements are integrated into the memory arrays to help overcome the data movement bottleneck associated with AI computing,\u201d the company said.\u201cUniform deposition of the new materials used in ReRAM memories is critical to achieving the highest possible device performance, reliability and endurance,\u201d said George Minassian, CEO and co-founder of Crossbar, Inc. \u201cWe specify the Applied Materials Endura Impulse PVD system with onboard metrology in our ReRAM technology engagements with memory and logic customers because it enables a breakthrough in these critical metrics.\u201dCommenting on today\u2019s announcement, Mukesh Khare, VP, semiconductors, AI hardware and systems, IBM Research, said, \u201c\u2026we see the need for these technologies increasing as the AI era demands improvements in chip performance and efficiency. New materials and device types can play an important role in enabling high-performance, low-power embedded memory for IoT, Cloud and AI products. Applied Materials\u2019 high-volume manufacturing solutions can help accelerate the availability of these new memories across the industry.\u201d",
