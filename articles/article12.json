    "text": "High performance storage specialist Quantum Corp. this morning announced an addition to its F-Series line of NVMe storage servers \u2013 the F1000 comes in at a lower price point than its F2000 counterpart announced at NAB last year while utilizing that appliance\u2019s software-defined architecture designed for streaming performance and response times in \u201cvideo and video-like infrastructures,\u201d to use the company\u2019s phrase.Built to support Quantum\u2019s product line strategy \u2013 focused on large-scale video and image data sets \u2013 \u00a0the F-Series is designed for studios, corporations and government agencies \u201cto accelerate the capture, edit and finishing of high-definition content, and speeds VFX and CGI render performance by 10x-100x, to develop cutting edge augmented and virtual reality,\u201d the company said.Available in two capacity points: 39 TB and 77 TB, the F1000 offers the same connectivity options as the F2000, according to Quantum:\u00a0 32 Gb fiber channel, or iSER / RDMA using 100 Gb Ethernet, and deployed within Quantum StorNext scale out file storage clusters.Quantum Corp. has had its ups and downs in recent years. The company is led by CEO Jamie Lerner, hired in July 2018 after \u201cunhealthy\u201d (Lerner\u2019s word) business practices investigated by the SEC led to the company stock being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The company later regained its listing and the stock, bottoming out at less than $1.50 a year ago last month, stood at $7.09 as of this writing.Quantum said its F- Series appliances are not general purpose NVMe storage arrays, they have been designed for the requirements of video and image-based workloads for movie, TV and sports production, marketing and advertising content, or image-based workloads that require high speed processing, such as data from a satellite feed, a drone or a car used in the development of automated driver assistance systems.\u201cUnstructured data is created in many ways as it enters its lifecycle,\u201d said Amita Potnis, Research Director, Infrastructure Systems, IDC. \u201cQuantum's high-performance NVMe flash-based storage offering is well-suited to ultra-high-def content, high-resolution images, and other forms of video and video-like datasets. The F1000 shows great promise for addressing the requirements for ultra-fast reads and writes and parallel processing for a wide range of use cases.\u201dA 1U storage server, the 10 NVMe-drive F1000 offers the same streaming performance (25-30GB/sec) of its 2U F2000 brethren but without the 24-drive F2000\u2019s no-single-point-of-failure, high-availability design.\u00a0 Bassier said the F1000 product strategy was guided in part by customer feedback since the introduction of the F2000.\u201cA lot of the feedback from customers and partners throughout the year was they love the performance of NVMe, they love the feature set of the software, they just don\u2019t necessarily need the high availability architecture of this server, which comes with a cost premium, right\u2026? So the F1000 is kind of the little brother of the F2000. It is a lower price NVMe storage server with best in class price performance.\u201dQuantum said the F1000 will ship in March.",
