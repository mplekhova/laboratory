    "text": "GDPR compliance requires ongoing data management of customer data, and if your organization hasn\u2019t been fully attentive to this matter, consider these five best practices for data migration, data management and long-term data retention:1: Integrated Archiving and Backup\nRegarding backups, your company may face higher risk if it doesn\u2019t use an integrated archive and backup that ensures only one instance of data gets stored for both. Keep in mind that to be GDPR compliant, archiving systems must be able to:Seek an archiving tool that allows you to offload data that\u2019s used less often into a secondary system, which reduces data stored in production systems. Cloud-based archiving and backup solutions offer faster implementation, which can be important where compliance is concerned.2: Dark DataUnmanaged, unstructured data gobbles up pricey enterprise storage space to the tune of hundreds of terabytes. Many companies are unaware that they have a major problem with this type of \u201cdark data.\u201d It can be comprised of any number of unmanaged files, including PSTs and backups of employee desktops, email accounts from departed employees, eDiscovery sets of results, system generated files and more. Old PSTs are a particularly telling symptom of dark data. Many IT administrators simply have no idea how many of these files exist \u2014 much less how to appropriately manage them.The best practice is the most cost-effective one \u2014 rather than trying mass deletion and likely losing something valuable, or hiring consultants who charge hundreds of dollars an hour to rifle through your large volumes of dark data, use a system that is designed to do this work for you much more inexpensively. Seek an information management system that culls dark data quickly via consolidating unstructured data and fully indexing it, simplifying search by keyword, custodian, last date accessed, etc.3: Defensible Data MigrationDuring data migration when responding to an eDiscovery request, two things are required by GDPR to prove legal defensibility: chain of custody and data fidelity. Chain of custody is used to prove that the data remains unchanged during the passing of the data from one person to another. This comes into play if a file\u2019s originality is questioned \u2014 the company must be able to produce a documented history of direct management and protection.That\u2019s a piece of the puzzle, but only one piece. Data fidelity, or the measure of similarity to the data\u2019s original state, is also critical. Only when the data fidelity is 100 percent can the data be considered completely unaltered. This is a requirement of the eDiscovery process \u2014 that any data that may be relevant remain completely unaltered. If a migration solution provider says you only need to worry about chain of custody reporting to ensure legal defensibility, dig further. The fact is, such providers may potentially alter or intentionally delete file properties, increasing your risk of a spoliation charge.Before migrating data that could be considered evidence, do these two things:4: Address Your \u201cLeaver Data\u201dWhen someone leaves a company, it\u2019s important to know how to properly manage and archive the departing employee\u2019s valuable data to avoid potential compliance risks and increased eDiscovery costs. As a best practice, enterprises need to ensure that they have a way to manage these files as the valuable company asset that they are; if this data is disregarded and lost but later needed for legal reasons, it can become a nightmare, or even become impossible, to find or resurrect, which can be a serious problem given the time constraints of eDiscovery requests.As a best practice when dealing with leaver data, follow these two steps:5: Journaling ComplianceGDPR regulations require that email communications be available to ensure that if a party wishes to have its information deleted (the right to be forgotten), the data can be discovered and removed. Email journaling can ensure this. However, it\u2019s important to understand how journaling works. The journal mailbox isn\u2019t actually an archive, which means this data still needs to be archived. Otherwise, you may end up in trouble when the journal mailboxes fill up and overwrite current journaled email.Litigation preparedness is a big reason to use email journaling. During a lawsuit, companies implicated must place a litigation hold on all potentially relevant data. The opposing counsel may ask for responsive data within an open-ended date range, which means placing a litigation hold on all email\u2014past, current, and new. By immediately journaling a target employee\u2019s mailbox, you can ensure all affected email is captured and placed on hold. It\u2019s prudent to automatically journal your C-level employees\u2019 email and hold it for 2+ years, since those employees ostensibly have a higher risk of being summoned in a lawsuit.Many companies are moving their email to newer systems. Even so, many can\u2019t provide live journaling capability, so it is recommended that one use an on-premises or third-party cloud archive as the journal mailbox. This isn\u2019t the best solution, though, because it\u2019s costly, and may end up costing more. Relying on a third-party cloud archive can also lead to vendor lock-in issues.A better solution is relying on a public cloud, which not only helps lower costs but provides security and offers unlimited scalability. It wasn\u2019t always possible to journal from your email system to the cloud, but technological advances have made this possible. Previously, public clouds could not manage a journal\u2019s complexities. No longer, since there are new cloud journaling solutions. This enables a live email stream to move directly into the company\u2019s cloud where it can be validated and managed, using the customer\u2019s own encryption keys to secure data. By journaling to the company\u2019s own cloud, the platform addresses both vendor lock-in and high costs \u2014 a perfectly compliant solution.Bill Tolson is vice president at Archive360.",
