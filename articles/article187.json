    "text": "The healthcare sector along with the explosion of connected devices are driving the big data storage market, according to a new survey of the global storage market that pegs annual growth over the next decade at more than 20 percent.The storage surge also is prompting more vendors to integrate predictive analytics with software-based storage options while moving storage closer to end user data to reduce latency, concludes a market survey released by Persistence Market Research.Overall, the survey forecasts that the global big data storage market will reach $61.44 billion by 2026.While hardware-based storage currently accounts for nearly half of capacity, software-based storage is expected to expand over the next decade to more than $11 billion. The survey warns \"the hefty overall cost of acquiring flash storage\" is among the macroeconomic factors that could slow the growth of hardware-based storage.Read the full story at sister web site Datanami.George Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
