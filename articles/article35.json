    "text": "An open source group is expanding its third-party security audits to include the popular but vulnerable Kubernetes cluster orchestrator.The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) announced this week it would add Kubernetes to its pilot program of public security audits. Earlier audits of other open-source projects\u2014CoreDNS, Envoy\u00a0and Prometheus\u2014uncovered security issues ranging from \u201cgeneral weaknesses to critical vulnerabilities,\u201d the group said.The expansion also responds to a steady stream of Kubernetes vulnerabilities, including an API flaw\u00a0uncovered this week that allowed unauthorized access to cluster-wide resources.Kubernetes is among a growing list of open source projects overseen by CNCF\u00a0that are widely used in production. The earlier audits would serve as a framework for securing Kubernetes as it grows in popularity.\u201cThe main takeaway from these initial audits is that a public security audit is a great way to test the quality of an open source project along with its\u00a0vulnerability management\u00a0process and more importantly, how resilient the open source project\u2019s security practices are,\u201d CNCF Director Chris Aniszczyk noted in a blog post.An evolving \u201cthreat model\u201d will probe key components of the cluster orchestrator, including authentication, authorization, cryptography, multi-tenancy, networking and \u201csecrets management.\u201dThe Kubernetes audit working group also will scan eight Kubernetes components for security flaws:\u00a0Security vendors praised the Kubernetes security audit.\u201cWhile many observers will emphasize the number and severity of vulnerabilities that were reported, that focus misses the forest for the trees,\u201d said Wei Lien Dang, co-founder and vice president of\u00a0StackRox, an application container security specialist.The CNCF audit \u201cprovides value far more broad and critical than identifying additional vulnerabilities,\u201d StackRox added. \u201cSuch vulnerabilities will keep surfacing\u2014with or without this audit, given the combination of the rich code base with such broad, rapid adoption.\u201dAmong the initial security recommendations from the CNCF audit panel aimed at Kubernetes developers are avoiding the \u201chardcoding\u201d of paths to orchestrator dependencies and monitoring often unsecured Linux code.Additional details on the Kubernetes security audit are here.\u00a0George Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
