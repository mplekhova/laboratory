    "text": "On the heels of an over-subscribed $93M series D funding round announced two weeks ago,\u00a0 high performance file storage specialist Qumulo today launched a new product series that it says breathes new life into what typically is cold, hard-to-access archival data, making historical data more visible, performant and usable for operational and high performance analytics workloads.Qumulo\u2019s Nearline Archive Series scale-out storage combines Qumulo\u2019s File Fabric (QF2) with cloud data center-standard server hardware using high density 12TB drives and Intel Xeon SOC chipsets. A Nearline Series server has the capacity for 144 terabytes of data in 1U \u201cpizza box\u201d of rack space, according to Qumulo, and is capable of 6GB/second of reads, 3GB/second of writes per usable petabytes of data stored in the system. To scale, Qumulo product manager Jason Sturgeon told us, customers purchase another Nearline server and connect them via their 10GB network ports. The result, according to Qumulo, is scalability to billions of files and 20-40 percent improved storage efficiencies over existing legacy storage for large and small files.Qumulo said the Nearline series overcomes existing archive storage technologies characterized by low-volume, proprietary hardware, holding customers back from innovations in advanced server components that leaves archived data off-line and relatively inaccessible. The need, according to the company, is to enliven what would otherwise be cold data.\u201cBecause of all the advancements in computing and the ease with which people can deploy lots and lots of computing resources and point it at problems in business today, all data is active now in some way,\u201d Qumulo CMO Peter Zaballos told EnterpriseTech. \u201cWe used to put data in an archive for safety. But now you need to put it someplace where you can access it really easily. The idea that you\u2019re putting data where it\u2019s not going to be looked at for a long time, that\u2019s the obsolete part. You need to have all of your data accessible.\u201dZaballos said a key to Qumulo\u2019s archived data strategy is the QF2 file fabric\u2019s ability to leverage metadata. \u201cOne of the innovations we brought to the market was a file system that collected the metadata when it wrote the data to the storage location, so on the way in we collected the metadata,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you want to find out something about what you\u2019re storing, we just ask the metadata and you get an answer very quickly. We don\u2019t have to check every location. In an age (when customers have) billions of files, this is a total game changer. We can give you literally instant visibility into the state of storage, where it is, who\u2019s using what\u2026 We give you (archival data) performance like it\u2019s part of your main active data.\u201dQumulo said QF2 runs on premises and in the cloud and uses continuous replication to create a data fabric that interconnects QF2 clusters, whether it\u2019s all-flash, high-performance hybrid SSD/HDD, nearline archive or running on EC2 instances in AWS.Earlier this month, Qumulo announced it closed a Series D funding round $93 million lead by BlackRock Private Equity Partners and included Goldman Sachs and Western Digital along with existing investors Highland Capital Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Madrona Venture Group and Valhalla Partners.",
