    "title": "In Advanced Computing and HPC, Dell EMC Sets Sights on the Broader Market Middle",
    "text": "If the leading advanced computing/HPC server vendors were in the batting lineup of a baseball team, Dell EMC would be going for lots of singles and doubles \u2013 and some home runs, too \u2013 trying to hit for a high batting average. The cleanup hitter would be HPE, swinging for the fences with recent acquiree and supercomputing powerhouse Cray. The tradeoff in Dell EMC\u2019s strategy: win more deals in the broader middle market knowing that HPE and Cray will grab bigger headlines and boast more mega-deal marquee spots at the top of the HPC Top500 list.We recently sat down with Dell EMC\u2019s Thierry Pellegrino,\u00a0VP Business Strategy & HPC Solutions Server and Infrastructure Systems, to discuss his company\u2019s positioning in the consolidating advanced computing industry. Central to his vision of competing against co-market leader (see below) HPE, whose acquisition of Cray was preceded by its 2016 purchase of SGI), is his view that the mid-market is expanding as AI and other high-demand workloads become more widely adopted; this in turn requires vendors to deliver servers, software and services tailored for customers lacking in HPC-class computer science skills. Ergo: the company is building an HPC product portfolio for the middle quintiles of the high end systems industry.\u201cLook, our strategy is clear,\u201d Pellegrino told us. \u201cWe're not trying to get a majority share of the entries in Top 500. We're not trying to win every single exascale computer out there.\u2026\u201dThe focus, he said, is on higher volume, smaller scale systems. \u201cThere's a lot to be done in kind of the middle of the pyramid. The top of the pyramid, we can and will play there, but we don't want to dedicate our energy to being the leader in that space. And then, you know, HPC becomes more and more mainstream in a certain way. So a big part of what we want to do as we follow our three tenets \u2013 which is advancing, optimizing and democratizing HPC \u2013 is to make HPC available to smaller size customers where the type of workloads they want to run doesn't run on a single server, doesn't run on two servers, they need some level of parallelism, and they don't want to go and design or understand how to build a cluster, but they'd like to have access to that technology. We want to be that partner that can simplify it for them and make it available.\u201dStill, Pellegrino said, when a supercomputing opportunity presents itself that Dell EMC feels is a good fit, the company will compete. He cited two elite systems wins: \u201cFrontera,\u201d installed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas in Austin in 2018, a Dell C6420 system utilizing Intel Xeon Platinum processors with throughput of 23.5 petaflops, ranked fifth on the Top500 list; and, currently claimed by Dell EMC to be the most powerful industrial supercomputer, \u201cHPC5\u201d at Italian utility giant Eni, comprised of 1,820 Dell EMC PowerEdge C4140 servers with Intel Gold 6252 24-core processors and four Nvidia V1000 GPUs, with peak power of 70 petaflops, announced last October.\u201cOur customers want to know they can come to a partner that can deploy large scale, whether it be processor-based or GPU-based, or different types of processors,\u201d Pellegrino said.Even as HPE mounts an increasingly formidable challenge with Cray and SGI under its hood, Pellegrino contended that industry consolidation has had the unintended consequence of raising Dell EMC\u2019s profile, by process of elimination.\u201cLet's talk about HPE buying two of our competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cSo on the on the one hand, it's building up HPE to being a bigger company in the HPC space. It's great for them. On the other hand, look at the landscape. It used to be Cray, SGI, Dell, EMC, Lenovo. So we've seen a consolidation, and it has an interesting side effect. A lot of customers are looking for either alternative technologies or choice in their environment.\u201cSo for customers that want to have at least two sources for their systems, we've become really an interesting partner to call to the party. And we see that more and more. So even though it might be counterintuitive \u2013 to see HPE acquire SGI and Cray as maybe a competitive environment that's going to hurt Dell EMC \u2013 it's actually helped us gain even more relevance in discussions where we're called to come in to be the that second source or sometimes being that first source.\u201dAssessing the results of Dell EMC\u2019s middlebrow HPC strategy depends on whose market share analyses you subscribe to.As of its most recent HPC market update, covering the first half of 2019, released during the SC19 supercomputing conference in November, industry analyst firm Hyperion Research reported that in the $6.7 billion HPC server sector, HPE has 35 percent market share \u2013 not including Cray\u2019s 2.3 percent share \u2013 while Dell EMC is at 21 percent.Meanwhile, Intersect 360 Research reported at SC19 that for 2018, HPE and Dell EMC were virtually tied for HPC server market share, and the firm\u2019s president, Addison Snell, said that when HPC server and storage market shares are combined, Dell EMC leads HPE, 29.8 percent vs. 25.6 percent.Whatever the case may be, a central element of Dell EMC\u2019s democratization strategy are \u201cReady Solutions,\u201d jointly engineered with business partners and designed to deliver tested high performance configurations for specific use cases, such as HPC, AI, data analytics, software-defined infrastructure, along with vertical focus areas within those categories. The idea is to offer design choices that accelerate deployments and scaling.The goal, Pellegrino said, is \u201cto simplify the discussion with our customers, whether they're in manufacturing or they're in life sciences, or in any kind of AI type of workload they're trying to solve.\u201dWhile some customers have the skills and experience to build their own clusters, Pellegrino said, for the \u201cbig majority\u201d of Dell EMC customers \u201cstarting with a clean sheet is a daunting moment.\u201d He cited several new solutions, reference architectures and technology upgrades for HPC storage and AI, announced in November.On the HPC storage side, Dell EMC announced turnkey solutions for ThinkParQ\u2019s BeeGFS and ArcaStream\u2019s PixStor software-defined parallel file system, designed for I/O-intensive workloads and scalable from small clusters to enterprise-class systems on premises or in the cloud, according to the company.Dell EMC also launched a an AI Ready Solutions for the Domino Data Science Platform, designed to help data scientists develop models faster while providing a data science lifecycle platform. The company also released Dell EMC reference architectures for DataRobot, Grid Dynamics, H20.ai, Iguazio and Kubeflow on Red Hat OpenShift.\u201cLook, it's great to be in a world where technology is advancing at such a pace, but it's becoming very complicated,\u201d Pellegrino said. \u201cBetween the processors, the memory types, the storage types, the accelerator types, the level of cooling and power delivery that you need to think of, the deployment, the cost of deployment tools, the different stacks, whether you're doing traditional HPC, data analytics or (AI) inferencing or training, or even if in in an enterprise class environments \u2013 how do you integrate all this with a cloud environment, with something that is vastly distributed? We have to answer all those questions. And little by little, we're building up all those building blocks that help our customers really do everything they want to.\u201d",
