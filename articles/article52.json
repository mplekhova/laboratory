    "text": "Investors are zeroing in on the open standard RISC-V instruction set architecture and the processor intellectual property being developed by a batch of high-flying chip startups.Last fall, Esperanto Technologies\u00a0announced a $58 million funding round. The chip IP vendor is incorporating more than 1,000 RISC-V cores onto a single 7-nm chip. Data storage specialist Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) is an early investor in Esperanto, Mountain View, Calif.This week, another RISC-V startup, SiFive, announced a $65.4 million funding round that included new investor Qualcomm Ventures. SiFive, San Mateo, Calif., has so far raised more than $125 million, and is seen as a challenger to chip IP leader Arm.Observers note that wireless modem leader Qualcomm is among Arm\u2019s biggest customers, making its investment in SiFive intriguing. Also participating in the Series D round were existing investors Chengwei Capital of Shanghai along with Sutter Hill Ventures and Spark Capital. Intel Capital and Western Digital also were early investors.Western Digital serves on the board of the RISC-V Foundation\u00a0along with representatives of Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and the University of California at Berkeley.Founded in 2015, SiFive is developing RISC-V core IP with the goal of expanding access to custom silicon. The chip startup claims more than 100 design wins\u00a0based on its system-on-chip (SoC) templates. The template allows customers to accelerate the fabrication of RISC-V processors and custom SoCs, moving from design to prototyping to the delivery of sample chips \u201cwithin weeks,\u201d the company claims.During the prototyping phase, customers can run application code on virtualized chips to tweak performance before chips are taped out, the company notes.The Silicon Valley startup has design facilities in: Beaverton, Ore., near Intel\u2019s Hillsboro campus; Austin, Texas; Boston; Bangalore and Pune, India; Shanghai; the global chip manufacturing hub in Hsinchu, Taiwan; and Seoul, South Korea.Qualcomm\u2019s participation in SiFive\u2019s latest funding round attracted notice since the wireless chip maker is a long-time customer of Arm. \u201cSiFive has established itself as a leader in the RISC-V space, making significant contributions to the broader semiconductor industry through its unique design methodology,\u201d said Quinn Li, who heads Qualcomm Ventures.Qualcomm is a founding member of the RISC-V Foundation.Industry watchers note that SoC designs increasingly require a portfolio of IP cores to accelerate chip design. \u201cYou can't build an SoC with just the CPU,\u201d Mike Demler, a semiconductor technology analyst with The Linley Group, noted in a tweet. \u201cBut it's just one small step toward building a comprehensive IP ecosystem. That is Arm\u2019s biggest advantage.\u201dHence, SiFive positions itself as an Arm competitor able to deliver custom silicon \u201cas device manufacturers rapidly adopt domain-specific application processor designs in response to the point of compute migrating to the [network] edge.\u201d Those edge applications require extremely low power consumption.SiFive\u2019s key differentiator is its claimed ability to compress the design, prototyping and chip sampling steps, enabling the delivery of custom silicon in a few weeks.\u00a0George Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
