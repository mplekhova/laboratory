    "text": "The powerhouse team of Apple and General Electric are joining forces to offer predictive data and analytics industrial apps from Predix, GE\u2019s IIoT platform, to Apple iPhones and iPads. Today, the two companies unveiled a new Predix software development kit (SDK) for Apple\u2019s iOS, tools for developers to make their own industrial IoT apps.The companies said Predix SDK for iOS, which will be available for download tomorrow, enables developers to make native apps that leverage Predix industrial analytics along with \u201cthe power and ease of use of iOS, the world\u2019s most advanced mobile operating system.\u201d Apps will be used to give industrial operators insight into the performance of their equipment and operations from their iPhone or iPad.\u201cFor example, a Predix app can notify a worker on their iPhone of a potential issue with equipment, such as a wind turbine, and allow them to collaborate with remote teams when performing inspections and repairs, collecting relevant data instantly. These industrial apps will close the information loop faster, ultimately increasing cost savings and minimizing unplanned downtime,\u201d the companies said in a prepared announcement.The two companies also are collaborating on new apps for both internal use and for GE customers. GE\u2019s Asset Performance Management (APM) Cases app, which is available in the App Store, is designed to help industrial businesses increase machine reliability and availability and reduce maintenance costs while managing operations risks.GE cited Exelon Corp., Chicago, a Fortune 100 energy company with 34,000 employees, as an adopter of APM for improving equipment uptime and overall productivity.\u201cApple is known for setting the standard on hardware and simple software interfaces,\u201d said Brian Hoff, director of corporate innovation at Exelon. \u201cWhen you combine this with the power of Predix and all of the data Exelon is aggregating and analyzing, the possibilities for game-changing solutions are endless.\u201dGE said it will standardize on iPhone and iPad for mobile devices and also promote the Mac personal computer as a choice for its 330,000 global employee workforce. Apple will promote GE\u2019s Predix as the IIoT analytics platform of choice to its customers and developers.\u201cOur customers increasingly need to arm their workforces through mobility,\u201d said John Flannery, chairman/CEO, GE. \u201cWorking together, GE and Apple are giving industrial companies access to powerful apps that help them tap into the predictive data and analytics of Predix right on their iPhone or iPad.\u201d\u201cGE is an ideal partner with a rich history of innovation across the industrial world in areas like aviation, manufacturing, healthcare and energy,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cTogether, Apple and GE are fundamentally changing how the industrial world works by combining GE\u2019s Predix platform with the power and simplicity of iPhone and iPad.\u201d",
