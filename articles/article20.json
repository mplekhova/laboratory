    "text": "This year\u2019s chair of the HPC Impact Showcase at the SC19 conference in Denver is Lori Diachin, who has spent her career at the spearhead of HPC. Currently deputy director for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Exascale Computing Project\u00a0(ECP), Diachin is also deputy associate director for science and technology in the Computation Directorate at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which has about 1000 staff serving the laboratory in areas ranging from HPC, computing sciences and information technology for business and workforce enablement.Diachin knows a thing or two about applying HPC to commercial industrial workloads, having run DoE\u2019s HPC4Mfg (manufacturing) and HPC4Materials programs several years ago. Now, as chair of the Impact Showcase and in her roles at ECP and at Livermore, she\u2019s experiencing firsthand the confluence of HPC and AI.Of the HPC community and the explosion of AI over the past four years, she said, \u201cit\u2019s astonishing how quickly (it) has turned in that direction\u2026, it\u2019s a speed train.\u201dThis is seen in the three-day agenda of next week\u2019s HPC Impact Showcase, starting Tuesday, Nov. 19, focusing on industrial implementations of supercomputing and other advanced technologies. Seven of the series\u2019 15 sessions this year will have AI- and machine learning-related content.\u201cThe applications are all over the map,\u201d Diachin said, \u201cranging from looking at machine learning for cybersecurity \u2013 that\u2019s a project in collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) and a company called Webroot, data analytics for understanding traffic congestion and using AI to improve the analysis, high efficiency engines, JP Morgan Chase looking at cybersecurity pattern matching, and we\u2019ve got some folks from Wales looking at data analytics and genomics for HIV drug resistant; Total Oil and gas, and\u2026digital pathology, looking at whole slide image analysis using AI.\u201dGenerally, selection of showcase presentations is a submission-driven process, Diachin said, in which the reviewers look for examples of HPC making an impact on a particular industrial setting. Diachin, working with Suzy Tichenor (director, HPC Industrial Partnerships Program in the Computing and Computational Sciences Directorate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory), David Martin (manager, Industry Partnerships and Outreach at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility at Argonne National Laboratory), said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want talks about a new technology offering a company has, we didn\u2019t want talks from high performance computing centers that may be impacting industry, what we really wanted to hear from were the industrial partners themselves,\u201d that is: the organizations using and benefiting from HPC.This includes a presentation from GigaIO and the SDSC on the role of numerical simulation in analyzing and various physical phenomena. Storage I/O performance and network bandwidth have lagged behind improvements in compute power, creating a bottleneck for end-to-end simulation performance. Diachin said GigaIO has developed a new network technology that addresses this problem, and the presentation will describe how GigaIO partnered with SDSC to deploy a solution using earthquake simulation as a representative problem.\u201cWe tried something new this year\u2026,\u201d Diachin said, \u201ca tag-team approach. So my committee was primarily comprised of folks from HPC centers, either the DOE labs or universities, and most of us have industrial partnership projects, so we\u2019re trying as a tag-team approach where the industrial partners will talk for 20 minutes about their problem and why it\u2019s important, and then the lab or university partner will talk about what they did in particular w that partner to create an HPC solution that works for that company.\u201dAnother tag-team presentation will feature a demonstration of how an IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer, called \u201cMira,\u201d at Argonne National Lab was used to help Aramco Services, the Houston energy company, optimize a heavy-duty gasoline engine for improved efficiency. Using Mira, the team ran thousands of engine design combinations in a few days that would ordinarily require months on a typical cluster, enabling rapid evaluation of more variations. \u201cAnd then they\u2019re going to talk about taking all those simulations and using AI/machine learning techniques to analyze the output of the simulation results,\u201d Diachin said.While the convergence of HPC and AI has tremendous potential to take on grand challenges in industry and science, Diachin said, \u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done on understanding some of the foundational elements\u2026. When we look at it in the context of simulations, we\u2019re doing a lot of foundational work on understanding how you put that kind of physics-based knowledge into some of these techniques\u2026 There\u2019s huge potential and also some really important research that we need to tackle in the near-term to be sure we have solid foundations that were standing on.\"",
