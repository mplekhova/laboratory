    "title": "MapR Rebrands Around Converged Data Fabric",
    "text": "MapR Technologies today announced a major rebranding and repositioning of the data storage layer of its converged data platform. MapR-XD, as the data store is now known, provides the mechanism for customers to build a unified data fabric that stretches from edge devices, into the data center, and out to public clouds.The San Jose company says MapR-XD allows users to \u201ccreate vast, global data fabrics which are inherently ready for analytical and operational applications.\u201d The data fabrics created with the MapR-XD layer encompass multiple storage mechanism, including HDFS, NFS, REST, POSIX, and MapR Streams, and will support analytical and operational workloads running in batch, interactive, or streaming fashion, the company says.\u201cWe have a new product, MapR-XD, which is going to extend the MapR Converged Data Platform to help companies create the cloud-scale data fabric by managing files and containers for them, in mulit-temperature and multi-tier environments, and across the edge, on premise, and multiple clouds,\u201d says MapR\u2019s Senior Director of Industry Solutions Bill Peterson.The rebranding exercise was necessary to showcase the work that MapR has done in providing a single computer platform that can not only spans multiple physical and physical locations (like Docker), but can expose data through a variety of different APIs, including Hadoop-compatible file system (MapR-FS), a Kafka-compatible data pipeline (MapR-Streams), and a NoSQL database (MapR-DB).\u201cWhether you came into the platform from the file system or came in from the database or from Streams, you got multi-temperature [data management], you got the global name space, you got all the high availability,\u201d Peterson tells\u00a0Datanami. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never called it anything. We\u2019ve never branded around that. So as part of this exercise, we\u2019re going to rebrand that as the MapR Converge-X Data Fabric.\u201dPeterson continued:\u201cOur file system is now XD. We\u2019ve added a bunch to the file system and have quite a number of customers who are buying us just for storage and data management. And we\u2019ve done quite a work on Flash and improving I/O on Flash within the platform, and also with moving data between tiers, from Flash to disk to cloud, within the global namespace. Because of all of those reasons and the customers that we\u2019ve been securing, we\u2019ve decided to brand around this and go to market with a data storage and data management, which we really hadn\u2019t done before.\u201dMapR also announced that it\u2019s shipping a new version of its converged platform that\u2019s optimized for to run on Flash and NVMe disks. The core platform has now been split into two SKUs (or stock-keeping units): one for regular disk, and one for Flash disk.The company says two recent customer wins \u2014 with enterprise software maker\u00a0SAP\u00a0and consumer goods manufacturer\u00a0Samsung\u00a0\u2014 showcase its converged data fabric and Flash capabilities.SAP chose MapR to provide the core underlying platform that it will host its new cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) offering upon. HANA is the first piece of the SAP software suite that will run on MapR-XD, with more to follow.\u00a0 \u201cA lot of that work for optimizing I/O for Flash came out of this work\u201d with SAP, Peterson says. \u201cWe said, hey this is a good time to package this up and make it available.'\u201dSamsung, meanwhile, is using MapR as the underlying data store for Bixby, the voice-based virtual assistant that Samsung is building into its next-generation Galaxy S8 and S8+ phones. \u201cOver time, this is going to be huge. Trillions of files that we\u2019re going to need to store,\u201d Peterson says, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cretain forever model.\u201dMapR is also working with various automakers on their connected-car projects. In these engagements, cars roll along with MapR software managing the storage layer, and making that data available in the data center and the cloud as needed.It\u2019s all about eliminating silos with a global namespace, says Peterson, borrowing a term that\u2019s often used in the object storage system world. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability of our global namespace to move data from a data center to a cloud based on a tiring model or a temperature model,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all one global namespace. It\u2019s all one cluster. The application doesn\u2019t care or need to know.\u00a0 That, we find is huge.\u201dEventually, the MapR platform will support an object file system, namely Amazon\u2019s S3, which is the dominant protocol for accessing object file systems today. \u201cToday, we support files and containers.\u00a0 Object and S3 are roadmap,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cThe one we\u2019re not doing is block [storage] and the reason is, with block there\u2019s no metadata associated with it, there\u2019s no analytics.\u201dThere\u2019s meaning behind the name. The \u201cx\u201d stands for \u201canything,\u201d while the \u201cd\u201d stands for \u201cdata.\u201dAlex Woodie has written about IT as a technology journalist for more than a decade.
