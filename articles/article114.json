    "text": "Anything as immense, impactful and powerful as public cloud computing is bound to be variegated, encompassing the good, the bad and the ugly. As AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud and the other platforms gain more market adoption \u2013 usually in tandem with an on-prem data center \u2013 the benefits and landmines of cloud computing for compute- and data-intensive applications are becoming better understood.The good and the bad extend across technology, integration, cost control and change management challenges:How do know which workloads and data should be put in the cloud or kept on-prem? How can we build a comparative on-prem / off-prem business case that takes all costs into account? How do we ensure data security and regulatory compliance with our cloud workloads? How do we help our staff handle the wrenching change of integrating cloud computing within our IT infrastructure? How do we incorporate best practices that maximize our use of the cloud? Should our cloud strategy replicate our data center, or be something different? These and other issues were discussed by a panel of cloud technologists at Tabor Communication\u2019s recent Advanced Scale Forum in Austin, moderated by Merle Giles (former industrial lead at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois and founder of the advisory firm Moonshot Research).The GoodThe public cloud advantage most commonly highlighted by the panelists is its flexibility in an enterprise compute world that increasingly values experimentation, the spinning up and tearing down of instances for compute- and data-intensive applications, along with instant scaling up additional compute when workloads burst beyond the capacity of on-prem resources.\u201cThe good news about hyperscaler public clouds,\u201d said Ari Berman, vice president and GM of consulting services at The BioTeam, which offers HPC and IT guidance for life sciences organization, \u201cis it really does enable the type of workloads and expandability that organizations need on a temporary basis. You don\u2019t have to go build a 100,000-core machine to do your one week of data crunching. That\u2019s one of the most powerful things about it.\u201cAs long as you have a credit card,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can swipe and go to one of the clouds, spin up a couple of hundred thousand cores, go for a week, cry a little at the cost, but get the thing done and spin it down.\u201dBarbara Eckman, Ph.D., principal data architect, Comcast, expanded on Berman\u2019s comment, saying \u201cyou can spin up and use them to do some machine learning or reporting, and then shut them down and you don\u2019t have to pay for them being up 24/7.\u201dFor Steve Hebert, CEO of cloud HPC services provider Nimbix, a key benefit of public clouds is their ability to deliver true supercomputing-class power, something doubted by many when Hebert\u2019s company came on the scene in 2010.At that time, \u201cif you were doing grid-based computing or loosely-coupled types of workloads, you could definitely scale out,\u201d on a public cloud platform, Hebert said. \u201cBut for the real, critical applications that required either computation acceleration or very fast low latency fat network fabrics in the cloud, that was something that was\u2026simply not possible. The good news is now that it\u2019s very much possible and the cloud providers across the globe are investing heavily in these advanced technologies to support not just the initial web services side of IT workloads but also these advanced, data intensive types of workloads.\u201dAccording to Dan Powers, managing director at technology consulting firm Accenture, a great advantage of public clouds are the range of technologies they offer and their ability to remain more current with new technologies than is typically possible with on-premises data centers.\u201cThe good that I\u2019ve seen is the options that we all have today from a strategy perspective,\u201d Powers said. \u201cThere are more technologies you can start using internally to get better efficiencies at scale and save costs on your own on-prem environment that can be coupled in with offerings in industry around hybrid cloud\u2026 On the public cloud side, we always think of IaaS, but there are amazing choices for PaaS and SaaS on the public cloud as well.\"Competition among the public cloud providers also is driving much innovation and a wider variety of solutions, Powers said.\u201cYou may not see it behind the scenes but it is driving tremendous competition and dropping of costs and price,\u201d he said. \u201cCustomers look at different options for a hybrid compute strategy, and people will ask what should we do with our applications, should we migrate to the cloud, should we keep them on-prem, should we think about private cloud\u2026? Competition is one thing, but they are also changing their underlying hardware much quicker than one could do on-prem \u2013 so even during a five-year horizon, you see huge price-performance increases.\u201dThis particularly applies to companies with advanced analytics strategies, Powers said. \u201cThe technology out there for big data and machine learning is unbelievable, it is way better than you can do on-prem unless you have an unlimited budget, unlimited time and top professionals.\u201dHaving said that, Powers also pointed at the \u201cit\u2019s still early days \u2013 only 5 percent of enterprise workloads are actually sitting in cloud at this time. But the time to take advantage of the cloud is now.\u201dRick Friedman, principal program manager for Microsoft Azure (who came to Microsoft when it acquired HPC cloud specialist Cycle Computing last year) said a positive cloud development is the increasing cloud-savviness of enterprises.\u201cOn the good side has been the recognition that cloud is not the answer, it\u2019s an answer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other piece\u2026I see in cloud computing, particularly in HPC-driven and large computation cloud computing, is that it\u2019s driven by the commercial side of the business, as opposed to the academic side of the business. Historically, a lot of the advances in the models, methodologies and best practices we\u2019ve seen have all come out of the academic communities. And I think what I see from my world at Cycle and Microsoft is that the commercial aspects and commercial entities are driving evolution of cloud and its usage.\u201dThe BadMoving over to cloud\u2019s bad side, Berman discussed the \u201clack of understanding of how to use the cloud, how to use it effectively.\u201dThe cloud should not be treated as a replica of the on-prem data center, he said, \u201cit should be treated as a scriptable orchestratable architecture that can expand and contract as you need. If you utilize it correctly it\u2019s a great place for long-term storage for very large data, especially when you have lots of organizations computing on the data or using those data in interesting fashions. So large public data sets, reference data for life science, those sorts of things, are really good to sit in the cloud, especially when they\u2019re 10 PBytes in size, rather than having to download all that data through a 100 MByte connection (and your IT department won\u2019t spring for something bigger).\u201dAnother problematic area for the cloud: cost management.\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of our customers who just said, \u2018I want go all cloud, I don\u2019t want to have any data centers anymore,\u2019\u201d Berman said. \u201cAnd we helped them do that while telling them: \u2018Don\u2019t do that.\u2019\u00a0 But they did it anyway. And then five years later, a lot of them had this cloud sobriety moment: they say, \u2018That was awesome, but we need to go back to a hybrid infrastructure.\u2019\u201cI think that\u2019s one of the hardest things, is the lack of understanding of what cloud can do for you and what it can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI think serverless stuff is really awesome, and every cloud provider has some version of those services. And if you\u2019re going multi-cloud, people think you\u2019re going to do the same in all the clouds and get resiliency that way. Um, don\u2019t do that. Use them for what they\u2019re good for, they all have different service sets.\u201dEckman also raised the problem of cloud costs.\u201cThey get you in cheap, but hit you when you scale up, and it gets expensive really fast\u201d she said.Contributing to this problem: arcane pricing rules.\u201cYou can think you\u2019ve planned a really thrifty approach, but it can blow up in your face,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between capex and opex. When are finance people going to learn the money that you put into a cloud should come from the capex budget, at least some of it, because you are putting it into the cloud instead of buying big hardware for the data center. That\u2019s a major problem because of these huge opex budgets that are much bigger than they should be, and you\u2019re not using much capex at all. I find that enraging and really silly.\u201dFor Hebert, a bad aspect of the cloud is complexity.\u201cThe rise in the volume and number of services across all sorts of different IT solutions \u2013 it can be very complex, and that\u2019s where some of the cost comes in as you try to manage complexity,\u201d Hebert said.He also said that in accounting for the cost of cloud, it\u2019s important for users to calculate the value of insights derived. \u201cIt\u2019s the cost per answer that they get, not just the cost for compute and the infrastructure, but the business value that they get. How do we translate from measuring server hours and how many terabytes and petabytes you have stored, and start looking at the business value I\u2019m taking away, instead of this traditional on-prem / off-prem type of debate.\u201dPowers said transitioning to cloud within the existing IT infrastructure can present a major challenge, and success in this area requires strong senior leadership.\u201d\u201cWhen I think about the bad, it\u2019s not just about cloud, it\u2019s any technology change we\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a top senior executive level business case for the organization, at the CIO-CFO level. And it needs to be bottom-up.\u201dPowers said many managers have told him their models show that they can operate 20 to 30 percent less expensively on-premises than in the cloud. He then asks to see their business case, which often fails to account for on-prem power, real estate and systems management costs.\u201cThe organizations that I\u2019ve seen be most successful around cloud and the change to cloud is (when) the CFO and the CIO have a program in place that\u2019s based on a business case for the savings you\u2019re going to see across your organization. The finance people are not IT people, and the IT people are not finance. But if you get them together\u2026and you (figure out) how much it costs to run a server on a minute-by-minute basis and how much your storage is truly costing, then you can compare it against anything.\u201cYou can take that business case and give an RFP to all the cloud providers and ask them to \u2018beat this,\u2019\u201d Powers said. \u201cYou\u2019ve to go for it, you got to drive the organization to want to do that change and build that business case. That will remove the bad and get you into these pretty cool technology areas and take advantage of them.\u201dFriedman discussed the problem that some organizations encounter when moving their HPC-class compute- and data-intensive workloads, which over time can become a small world unto themselves, to the cloud.\u201cHistorically, HPC large computation, even the data and AI pieces of it, all of that often came from what\u2019s called the product side of business,\u201d Friedman said, \u201cand they have their own perspectives, revenue goals, and so forth. Then you have this function called IT. And in many organizations, where that product group has purchased an HPC system and over time built a beautiful brick wall around that resource, the problem is when you go to the cloud and you have to work with those people and they provide value, they really do, but now you have to get outside of that wall\u2026 Democratization\u2026doesn\u2019t work unless there are rules \u2013 one of the beauties of having walled garden is (there are) no rules. I bring this up because people don\u2019t understand this, that\u2019s why costs can get out of line.\u201dThe UglyLawyers tend to be unpopular, but Friedman recommended that companies moving toward the cloud for advanced scale workloads should bring in legal counsel.\u201cDo not underestimate the impact of lawyers on your project,\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t industry-accepted best practices on everything\u2026 For every company I deal with the questions of data protection and data privacy. Bring them (lawyers) into your projects as soon as possible.\u201dFor Hebert, deep integrations of cloud workloads with existing IT architectures and existing IT processes or data governance processes can be very ugly.\u201cMunging that into a cloud experience in some way, that can be very difficult,\u201d Hebert said, \u201cand it can really slow down the process. Software licensing is a good example because that\u2019s where sometimes IT plumbing needs cloud plumbing, and how do you get that together in a way that\u2019s secure and is compliant with existing IT and security policy?\u201dThe problems are solvable, he said, \u201cyou have to start with aligning strongly on the expectations and then how those get papered up. But I think there is great progress being made on all those fronts.\u201dFor Powers, cloud ugliness is \u2013 as mentioned above \u2013 organizations that try to directly transfer and replicate their old IT set-up in a public cloud.\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many white boards (with the client saying) \u2018this is what we\u2019ve got, now give me some of this on the cloud,\u2019\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cAnd we\u2019re taking those exact architectural approaches and applying that directly to the cloud when there\u2019s drastically different ways of doing things in the cloud if you would take a new sheet of paper and go the other way and say \u2018what can we do?\u2019\u201dHe said only about 10 percent of clients take a fresh perspective on optimizing the cloud.\u201cOne client in the financial industry took their massive application for the mainframe that they got ported to distributed systems through tiered architecture, and spent three months going through course after course after course with the cloud providers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then they got in a room and asked, \u2018How can we do things differently? How can we take advantage of a database that can handle petabyte data sets with trillions of rows and columns? If you have that, and you know it, and you understand it, and you can apply it to the problem, they\u2019re going to be able to search and re-build this application in a fraction of the time.\u201cSo the ugly is the architectures we\u2019ve had in the past and just trying to make them run in the cloud. But if you take a step back it can be pretty beautiful.\u201dBerman offered up three ugly cloud phenomena.Too many organizations, he said, neglect to put in place adequate connectivity to the cloud.\u201cNetworking is a fundamental need if you\u2019re going to go to any architecture outside of your data center for any data intensive applications, period. One hundred megabytes and a couple of T1\u2019s just isn\u2019t going to work. We\u2019ve had customers who go to their cable companies and get a cable modem in their data center because it\u2019s faster than what their own org provides.\u201dNext, Berman brought up cloud closed mindedness. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of dogma around what the cloud is, it\u2019s almost like a belief structure at this point rather than a rational set of architectures that people can use.\u201dIn healthcare and life sciences, he said, the prevailing dogma tends to either condemn or too enthusiastically embrace cloud. \u201cIt swings to the two extremes, not the middle where rational thought exists. The thinking is either \u2018we have to do it all in the cloud, this is awesome\u2019; or \u2018this is terrible, we\u2019re going to lose our collective heads doing this.\u2019For example, Berman said, data security regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA, convince some organizations that a public cloud can\u2019t be used. \u201cBut the truth is, if you architect it correctly, like anything, the cloud\u2019s probably more secure than anything you can build yourself.\u201dA third cloud factor to be wary of, Berman said, is sales and marketing hype that results in disappointing results. \u201cWhen people are trying to go to the cloud, the sales and marketing department is doing a great job of selling but not of demystifying. The end result is people go in with a set of expectations and come out having been dragged through the mud.\u201d",
