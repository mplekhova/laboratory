    "text": "As if there weren\u2019t enough security challenges, a forecast for the coming year warns the brave new world of AI and machine learning brings with it a whole new set of threats as microservices, the Internet of Things and multi-cloud deployments expand attack surfaces for hackers constantly probing for weaknesses.Market analyst Gartner\u2019s list of key technology trends for 2020 includes a compelling list of emerging trends, ranging from \u201chyper-automation\u201d to the \u201cdemocratization of expertise.\u201d Still, these emerging capabilities come with a price: As AI and machine learning add another layer of technological complexity, \u201cSecurity generalists cannot address the wide spectrum of risks efficiently in the current\u00a0risk landscape,\u201d Gartner has warned.The connection of platforms, edge devices and users expecting instant access to data\u2014structured and unstructured\u2014has raised the stakes for security as AI and machine learning enter the enterprise mainstream. \u201cSecurity and risk leaders should focus on three key areas \u2014 protecting AI-powered systems, leveraging AI to enhance security defense and anticipating nefarious use of AI by attackers,\u201d the market analyst warned in its rankings of AI-centric emerging technologies.Despite those heightened security concerns, a range of new technologies appear headed to wider enterprise adoption, Gartner said. Along with hyper-automation\u2014defined as the combination of machine learning, software and automation tools geared to performing specific tasks--Gartner foresees \u201cmulti-experience\u201d platforms including virtual, augment and mixed reality entering the mainstream in 2020.Technical expertise in the form of machine learning and application development is expected to fuel business segments ranging from economic analysis to sales and marketing, Gartner said in a survey of promising technologies released this week. Citizen data scientists are among the prime examples, but others including the \u201cevolution of citizen developers\u201d leveraging no-code models are also expected to emerge in 2020.Those efforts are driven by the ability to download open-source code and frameworks from platforms like GitHub. The problem, veteran software developers note, is that ease-of-use comes with a price in terms of security, reliability and other considerations.Meanwhile, edge computing and evolving cloud services are pushing ever-greater computing and storage capabilities deeper into enterprises. \u201cEdge computing will become a dominant factor across virtually all industries and use cases as the edge is empowered with increasingly more sophisticated and specialized computing resources and more data storage,\u201d said Brian Burke, a Gartner research vice president. \u201cComplex edge devices, including robots, drones, autonomous vehicles and operational systems will accelerate this shift.\u201dThe uptake in public cloud services is also expected to gain momentum as multi-cloud deployments give way to what Gartner dubs the \u201cdistributed cloud.\u201d That architecture is expected to transform deployments as public cloud providers take greater \u201cresponsibility for the operation, governance, updates to and evolution of the services,\u201d Gartner forecasts.\u00a0George Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
