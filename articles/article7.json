    "text": "Dell Technologies record annual revenues announced last week was nevertheless met with unease by shareholders wary of the outlook for its VMware business.Dell (NYSE: DELL) reported full-year revenues totaling $92.2 billion while fiscal fourth quarter revenue was up only 1 percent to $24 billion as a result of declining server and storage sales in the U.S. and China. Hence, analysts cited VMware\u2019s (NYSE: VMW) \u201cdisappointing outlook\u201d as a key reason both stocks tumbled last Friday (Feb. 28), a day of continuing virus-induced volatility on global financial markets.Market watchers cited VMware\u2019s acquisition of Pivotal Software and the resulting recasting of its financial statements as one reason for pessimism. Still, \u201cinvesting to become a cloud-centric business is the right move for VMware,\u201d concluded Viceni Investing in a research note.Jeff Clarke, Dell Technologies\u2019 chief operating officer, noted in a call with analysts that the Pivotal acquisition would combine \u201ccritical IP and go-to-market capabilities.\u201d Clarke also cited VMware\u2019s Project Pacific initiative, intended to upgrade its flagship vSphere server virtualization software using the de facto standard Kubernetes cluster orchestrator as its control plane. Longer term, Clarke said he is upbeat about the company's prospects.\"In FY '21, we're planning for both the overall server market and our server revenue to return to growth, driven by higher value workload servers, increasingly more robust AI and machine-learning solutions and distributed IT requirements at the edge,\" Clarke said. \"According to IDC, mainstream server revenue is expected to grow at 3.3 percent in calendar year 2020, and we plan to grow at a premium to the IDC forecast.\"Dell rolled out its infrastructure strategy late last year, focusing on combining its portfolio of products into \u201can all-in-one automated\u201d platform dubbed PowerOne. \u201cWe need a multi-cloud operational hub so we can orchestrate and automate the multi-cloud world,\u201d said John Roese Dell Technologies\u2019 president and CTO for products and operations. The next step is applying AI-driven automation and data security across enterprise infrastructure, Roese added.\u201cThe industry is at a critical juncture as cloud migration accelerates and fast-moving trends such as containers (Kubernetes) demand agility,\u201d Viceni Investing noted. VMware\u2019s \u201cmargins can improve as Pivotal and Carbon Black scale to profitability and as VMware\u2019s investments begin to bear fruit.\u201d Dell completed its acquisition of enterprise security vendor Carbon Black last October.Still, analysts remain wary of slowing growth as reflected in Dell\u2019s guidance. \u201cIt does feel like [Dell is] become increasingly cautious about [its] long-term outlook,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, a research analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\u201cOur model is built on long-term growth and consolidation of the market and share gain,\u201d responded Tom Sweet, Dell\u2019s chief financial officer.The infrastructure vendor continues to expand its cloud capabilities built around VMware\u2019s cloud and NSX network virtualization platform running on Dell EMC storage infrastructure. That combination is touted as providing \u201cconsistency across the entire ecosystem,\u201d COO Clarke said.Dell\u2019s partner network expanded this week with the integration of Pluribus Networks\u2019 software-defined networking tool with Dell EMC\u2019s \u201cvirtual edge\u201d platform. The partners said the modular platform can be used to host virtual networking functions.We also note that Dell Technologies' upcoming HPC Community Meeting remains on track to happen March 9-12 in Austin, TX, featuring sessions on\u00a0HPC integration with AI and edge computing and the prospects for neuromorphic and quantum computing.George Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
