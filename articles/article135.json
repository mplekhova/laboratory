    "text": "There was a simpler time when system tuning consisted of adjusting a relatively few number of knobs, a manual and not overly demanding task that brought out the best in systems performance. But now, as we move toward accelerated enterprise systems networked from data center to public cloud to mobile and sensored devices at the edge, simplicity in systems tuning is long gone.Today\u2019s bigger, more complex, connected and intelligent systems have an exponentially higher number of connections, dependencies, interfaces, protocols and processing architectures that, if not optimized, can hamstring networked systems. For performance engineers still using manual tuning methods, systems optimization is a time-eating hydra-headed monster that poses a virtually infinite number of possible adjustments and configurations for trial-and-error testing.Enter AI.Start-up Concertio today launched what it said is the first machine learning-based tool aimed at making \u00a0applications and systems operate for maximized performance by optimizing the myriad of configuration settings used in complex systems. While its initial product, Optimizer Studio, automates systems diagnostics and generates a \u201cgrocery list\u201d of adjustments that systems engineers and IT managers then review and implement, the next iteration of the technology (Optimizer Runtime) will automate both diagnostics and tuning implementation.None less than Mellanox has tested Concertio\u2019s effectiveness on its own networking technology. As part of today\u2019s launch, Concerto announced the results of a test involving Mellanox\u2019s ConnectX-3 Pro Ethernet cards that compared performance after automated testing by Optimizer Studio against manual tuning methods used by Mellanox performance engineers.The network cards were delivered in their off-the-shelf default settings, and then the Mellanox engineers and Concertio were informed of the workload the cards would be used for. Optimizer Studio ran against nine ConnectX-3 Pro specific knobs representing millions of option combinations. The tool\u2019s workload classification engine and reinforcement learning techniques modeled the target workload, detecting different workload phases, and experimenting with various knob configurations in each phase. It then produced a report showing the optimal settings for the specific use-case.The test result: Concertio won.\u201cIn the comparison test, Optimizer Studio\u2019s automated run improved performance in the target use-case by 80 percent, surpassing the 62 percent we achieved by manual tuning,\u201d said Amir Ancel, performance group director at Mellanox. \u201cOptimizer Studio\u2019s automated tuning algorithms allow us to focus on high-level optimization, leaving the mundane low-level parameter optimizations to software.\u201dBuilt for traditional datacenters, hyperscale datacenters and high-performance computing systems in the cloud or on-premises, Optimizer Studio monitors and learns from the interactions between applications and systems, according to Concertio.As of now, the tools support Linux-based systems running on Intel CPUs. Concertio said it intends to broaden its portfolio of supported technologies in upcoming product iterations.\u201cTuning used to be easy,\u201d Dr. Tomer Morad, Concertio co-founder and CEO, told EnterpriseTech. \u201cThere were only a handful of knobs, and you\u2019d put a performance engineer on that and tweak some settings and get some good results. But today we are already in the hundreds of knobs. It\u2019s exploding and become almost impossible to get to a very good result because the parameter space is practically limitless. If you have 100 binary knobs it\u2019s practically limitless, you cannot check everything. So you need some kind of automatic tool to help you with that.\u201dTuning variables, called tunable knobs, include settings across hardware, firmware, the operating system and applications such as:With so many variables, Morad said, performance engineers can\u2019t be expected to know about all of the available knobs, and to predict their effects on one another. IT professionals must also occasionally tune their systems, but it\u2019s difficult for them to maintain experts on all system internals, he said. Too often, engineers test and set optimal settings for a few knobs they are more familiar with, leaving the rest in default settings that were in place when the equipment was delivered. In some cases, he said, system tuning is overlooked entirely due to the complexity involved, and systems remain at inefficient under-performing factory settings.Beyond application performance tuning, Morad said the tool can be used for cutting cloud and data center costs by finding system configurations that use fewer resources, and it can be utilized by hardware and software product vendors to identify optimized off-the-shelf configurations for shipment to customers or reseller. It also can be used for maximizing public benchmark performance for marketing purposes.Privately-held Concertio (previously called DatArcs) was founded in 2016 and is based in New York City. The company is part of the Runway Program at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute of Cornell Tech in New York, and it\u2019s with the Intel Ingenuity Partner Program.\u201cTailor-tuned systems can significantly outperform baseline general-purpose systems, but the number of configurable settings has reached into the hundreds - way too many for any human team to effectively tune and test,\u201d said Concertio co-founder and CTO Andrey Gelman. \u201cIt used to be merely a gap that could be bridged by human tuning and testing, but with the increasing hardware and software complexity, it\u2019s exploding into a chasm where human performance tuning is netting diminishing returns, leaving these expensive systems bottlenecked and inefficient.\u201d",
