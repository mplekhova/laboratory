    "text": "IT departments are always asked to do more with less. But it is much easier to buy shiny new toys in a good economy than a bad one, which is one of the reasons why the all flash array (AFA) market has been so strong in recent years.If the economy turns south in 2016, which some are starting to predict, will IT spending patterns change?Let\u2019s take a look at the history books...In 2001, VMware first started shipping ESX, which was right on the heels of the\u00a0dot.com\u00a0recession.\u00a0 This product propelled the company to its current level of success.\u00a0Why was it so successful?\u00a0At that time,\u00a0IT departments were focusing their efforts on value\u00a0\u2013 concentrating spend on projects that improve the bottom line.\u00a0ESX provided a great way to do just that.\u00a0More specifically, it enabled companies to optimize server infrastructure using virtualization instead of buying more server hardware.\u00a0The ROI was real, and easy to quantify.Is there a lesson here?When the going gets tough, people optimize.\u00a0VMware made a name for itself selling software that optimizes server performance, and\u00a0Isilon became a multibillion dollar company by optimizing storage hardware with scale-out growth.\u00a0In both instances, the solutions were embraced because they minimized hardware expenditures while providing substantive value.So, what can we expect in 2016? Economic uncertainty will cause CIOs to harshly scrutinize IT spend in the coming year. This means it will be increasingly difficult to blindly throw hardware at problems.\u00a0For example, buying capacity to get performance in a storage array is inefficient and expensive, and will be increasingly tough to justify as customer affordability goes down. Similarly, investing in more onsite equipment will be seriously questioned in lieu of more cost effective cloud based services.In addition, other \u201cCadillac\u201d spends will be increasingly questioned.\u00a0For example, we are already seeing customers scrutinize their database environments more to see which individual instances require Oracle vs less expensive SQL server or MySQL.\u00a0And they are pushing back on investments in expensive in-memory computing solutions and specialized hardware like Exadata in favor of alternative solutions that provide equal performance at lower costs.Looking specifically at the storage space, in my opinion, these factors will cause the AFA and hyperconverged markets to soften a bit in the near term.\u00a0Companies will look to optimize their existing storage instead of replacing it with expensive new hardware.\u00a0And, unless more storage capacity is absolutely needed, they will hold off on purchasing new storage platforms until next generation solutions emerge with better scale-out capabilities (and other cost savings measures).",
