    "text": "HPC in the cloud is one of those \u201cinsanely great\u201d ideas that, failing to fire, year after year recedes before our expectations. Until, that is, last year, according to industry watcher Addison Snell, CEO of Intersect360, which he said was a \u201cbreak-out year\u201d for HPC in the cloud.At Intersect360's annual HPC market update at ISC18 in Frankfurt yesterday, Snell also stated that:The total worldwide HPC market (servers, storage, software, etc.) revenues, according to Intersect360, reached $35.4 billion in 2017, up 1.6 percent from 2016. Curiously, that anemic growth number contradicts the overall positive indicators from the \u201cdemand-side\u201d (buyers). The reason, Snell said, is that a significant amount of customer budgets was spent on increases in power and cooling costs at commercial sites. \u201cFacility spending was consuming a larger portion of budgets,\u201d he said, \u201cand not all of the demand side budget increase made it out into the market in terms of products and services.\u201dIntersect360 found HPE to be the top HPC server provider, followed closely by Dell EMC. In fact, those two companies had positive years in 2017, extending their market leadership positions. Meanwhile, Cray and IBM had down years despite the latter having delivered the world's first- and third-most powerful supercomputers.\u201cIBM fell back a little bit,\u201d Snell said. \u201cThis has been disappointing. It\u2019s a company having a great show at ISC here. There\u2019s the new Top500 list with \u2018Summit\u2019 and \u2018Sierra\u2019 nos. one and three\u2026. But in 2017 they did not have good traction with the Power9 servers, they\u2019re going to really need to get that going and figure out how to execute in this environment.\u201dIn a conversation after his presentation, Snell said he believes IBM emphasizes AI as the target workload for its high end servers \u2013 at the expense of their broader HPC applicability.\u201cIBM has a lot of the right pieces in place to gain market share across high performance computing, with not only their own products but all their partnerships,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have under-performed so far in their POWER division against the (potential) of what they\u2019re capable of doing. They could turn that around, but it would be a matter of strategically placing emphasis on HPC again and not just AI. They\u2019re clearly weighting their massaging toward AI.\u201d He said that at a recent IBM conference, Big Blue talked about even Sierra and Summit, built for the U.S. national labs, as AI systems.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous potential for Summit and Sierra to\u00a0 have a ripple effect for selling more Power9-GPU-Infiniband systems across the HPC landscape,\u201d he said, \u201cbut IBM would have to have an intentional strategy to go do that, instead of just talking about AI.\u201dHaving said that, machine learning is a growing aspect of the HPC firmament. By Intersect360\u2019s calculation, there was roughly $4.5 billion in dedicated machine learning spending worldwide last year, \u201cbut 95 percent is coming from the hyperscale market, where you have the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.\u201dOf the remaining measurable spending on ML, most is happening in financial services, which Snell is aggressively adopting AI.\u201cThis is the vertical furthest ahead in HPC in terms of real use cases for dedicated spending for deep learning,\u201d said Snell. \u201cWe love talking about self-driving cars and personalized medicine. But I promise you\u2019re going to have personalized interest rates long before you have personalized medicine. That is where the money is, and it\u2019s the areas that have money in them, like finance, advertising, and retail, and hyperscale, that are driving a lot more of the immediate investment in machine learning.\u201dThe hot growth segment of the industry in 2017 was cloud HPC. Though starting from a relatively small base, HPC in the cloud grew by 44 percent, to $1.1 billion, according to Intersect 360, exceeding the billion-dollar mark for the first time.\"HPC cloud computing really had a break-out year,\u201d Snell said, \u201cwhich we\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d Intersect360 expects cloud HPC to continue its hot pace, reaching $2 billion next year and $3 billion in 2022.This growth stems from two factors, Snell said: first, machine learning, and the movement of machine learning application to the cloud. \u201cThe ML types of applications have a great deal of cloud affinity, and have their roots in the hyperscale segment, so it\u2019s natural to migrate those.\u201dSecond and more important, Snell said: the maturation of licensing models, particularly for ISV codes in the high performance computing space. \u201cIt got easier in 2017 to migrate your Abacus license to the cloud, or Fluent, and that caused a lot of the spike for the higher value components, like SaaS.\u201dMeanwhile, high performance storage revenues were weak relative to server spending, Snell said, \u201cand that\u2019s because people were buying more computational, link-heavy configurations, mostly with GPUs, predominantly because of the influx of machine learning.\" Which is to say that with high prices for GPUs, there\u2019s less money left in budgets for storage.Intersect360 also reported that high performance storage vendors, such as DDN and Panasas, had off years in 2017.\u201cMore of the storage revenues flowed away from dedicated storage companies and toward server companies that were also selling storage,\u201d he said. \u201cThat goes along with that theme that people were buying things that are more integrated.\u201dLooking ahead, Intersect360 sees growth for the HPC industry\u2019s future.\u201cIn the forecast, we see a return to steady growth, primarily because the budget outlooks have improved across all three sectors (industry, government, academia),\u201d Snell said, \u201cparticularly government\u2026 it has the best forward looking outlook it\u2019s had had in the last five years. That\u2019s been flat, and it\u2019s finally starting to reengage again. So that\u2019s going to unlock some of the growth that we see here.\u201dBut for all the optimism about the industry\u2019s future, problems still exist. Snell cited \u201ctechnology disaggregation,\u201d the emergence of non-x86 accelerated processors, such as GPUs, FPGAs, Arm and others.\u201cThe big challenge is on the one hand end users are facing (a) diversifying set of workloads,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got all my traditional HPC stuff, and I\u2019ve got analytics and now I\u2019ve also got ML. On the other hand, I\u2019ve got a diversifying set of technologies, where I\u2019ve got to choose what processor type, what interconnect type, how many tiers of storage, and so forth. And the user is really afraid of getting burnt. I\u2019m going to go buy a bunch of stuff in this arch, and then in four years that\u2019s not going to be what I want for this workload.\u201dThe problem, he said, is \u201cthere are precious few technology vendors addressing this head on. Everyone\u2019s selling their own solutions.\u201dBut a vendor that not only has a spectrum of available solutions but also the ability to guide customers on the best use of those solutions to address the customer\u2019s workload portfolio \u201cwould have a major competitive advantage in this space. That\u2019s what we\u2019re waiting for \u2013 either from a major system vendor or from a major cloud vendor that can offer different types of instances.\u201d",
