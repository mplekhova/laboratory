    "text": "High performance storage vendor Qumulo today launched an updated line of distributed file storage solutions integrated with HPE\u2019s high-end Apollo 4200 Gen 10 Servers. Qumulo, whose partnership with HPE began two years ago, said the combined solution \u201cprovides enterprise organizations scalable, software-defined file storage with deep data visibility into unstructured data workloads that scale-across on-prem, hybrid and cloud environments.\u201dThe hybrid scale-out appliance comes in a 2U form factor and offers FIPS-2 Level 1 security compliance along with HPE\u2019s \u201csilicon root of trust\u201d technology, designed to prevent modifications to be made to hardware within the supply chain. Three configurations of the Qumulo-Apollo 4200 platform are available:\u00a0\u201cAs our customers seek to gain visibility into and control over their unstructured data, security and real-time analytics capabilities are emerging as top priorities for file storage solutions,\u201d said Bill Richter, CEO of\u00a0Qumulo. \u201cTo that end, this intelligence-enabled solution from\u00a0Qumulo\u00a0and HPE provides a whole new level of security coupled with unmatched data visibility from\u00a0Qumulo\u2019s real-time analytics and HPE\u2019s infoSight predictive analytics platform.\u201dIn its launch announcement, Seattle-based Qumulo cited a report from industry analyst firm IDC stating that the scale-out file storage market is growing rapidly in response to growing demand for processing, analyzing and storing massive unstructured data sets, reaching $11B market by 2022, up nearly 2X from previous forecasts. \u201cGlobal enterprises are increasingly looking to scalable file storage to address their massive unstructured data processing, analytics and retention demands,\u201d said Amita Potnis, research director, Infrastructure Systems, Platforms and Technologies Group at IDC.Molly Presley, Qumulo\u2019s head of worldwide product marketing, pointed out that as of 2017, IDC had projected the file system market to grow by a relatively tepid 10 percent through 2022.\u201cThe reason was that even though unstructured data was growing very quickly,\u201d Presley told us, \u201cfile systems in the legacy space really didn\u2019t have the capability to scale to meet massive unstructured data demand. So customers were starting to shift to on-prem object storage and (AWS) S3 in the cloud, looking at ways to take advantage of object technologies that accomplished scale.\u201cBut now that file systems\u2026have been designed for the modern world where they\u2019re designed for the cloud, they\u2019re designed for massive file counts, the market has shifted back towards a growth market for file storage, about a 60 percent increase in actual sales as well as projections moving forward.\u201dThe result, she said, is \u201ca tech shift\u201d in which modern file systems \u201care helping customers with having single-tier architectures, being able to analyze, create and archive in a single name space, instead of having to do tiering or HSM (hierarchical storage management).\u201dThe Qumulo-HPE offering is available from HPE and HPE VARs. HPE customers with cloud initiatives can also purchase\u00a0Qumulo\u00a0cloud offerings for Amazon Web Services through HPE.",
