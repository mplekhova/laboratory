    "text": "The care, feeding and sustained growth of the HPC industry increasingly is in the hands of the commercial market sector \u2013 in particular, it\u2019s the hyperscale companies and their embrace of AI and deep learning \u2013 that will drive healthy and stable, if not spectacular, expansion of the market through 2021 and beyond.Those are some of the top-line findings announced today by Addison Snell, CEO of HPC industry watcher Intersect 360 Research at the ISC conference in Frankfurt. Snell\u2019s other key findings include:That 3.5 percent growth in 2016 is a significant come-down from 2015\u2019s growth of 9 percent (mostly due to expansion in the storage sector) over 2014, according to Snell. His overall take on the coming years: long-term moderate, stable growth through 2021 and beyond.Among HPC server vendors, HPE continued its leadership in HPC server sales, claiming more than 33 percent market share over second place Dell EMC\u2019s 26.4 percent. HPE\u2019s lead was boosted by \u201ca couple of points\u201d by the incorporation of sales by SGI, which HPE acquired last year. They were followed by Lenovo, IBM and Cray. Snell noted that it was only two years ago that IBM was the top seller of HPC servers until announcing the sale of its x86 server business to Lenovo (currently with 6.9 percent of the market), which he said has underperformed based on the market share it acquired from IBM.On the storage side, Dell EMC continued its leadership with a 24.4 percent share, with NetApp slipping slightly to 15.8 percent, followed by HPE, IBM and HDS. DDN was reported to have a 3 percent share and Seagate at 2.9 percent.Snell emphasized that AI and deep learning are the drivers for HPC in the commercial sector.\u201cDeep learning and AI drives a lot of HPC-like investments, they\u2019re using a lot of GPUs, Infiniband, and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s being driven primarily by the hyperscale companies, like Baidu, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft. Traditional HPC companies might be looking at deep learning and AI but they\u2019re not spending a lot differently than they would have spent otherwise. We\u2019re not seeing big changes in budgets, even among major public sector supercomputer facilities.\u201dHe said an academic institution may have spent money last year on a new supercomputer that it plans \u201cto do some AI things with, it\u2019s the same supercomputer they would have bought otherwise.\u201dAmong non-hyperscale companies, he said HPC growth among commercial companies is led by the financial services sector, followed by manufacturing, then oil and gas.Snell said the study\u2019s most surprising finding: lack of market uptake for HPC in public clouds. Starting from a low base last year, Intersect 360 reported growth of 6.4 percent \u2013 not the 10 percent growth that had been expected. He said the market remains selective in the jobs it offloads to public cloud platforms, drawing an analogy to transportation decisions we make in everyday life: usually it makes the most sense to drive our own cars, but sometimes taking a taxi, the train or flying is the best choice. Similarly, he said, it usually makes the most sense for organizations to use own on-prem HPC capabilities.With public clouds holding 2.5 percent of the HPC market, Snell said Amazon has the largest share, adding that he is \u201creasonably sure\u201d Microsoft Azure overtook Google last year for second place among public cloud services providers, followed by IBM Softlayer.",
