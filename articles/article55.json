    "text": "In the scramble for the emerging 5G-\u201ccompute everywhere\u201d world to come (see Nvidia-Mellanox, Xilinx-Solarflare), high performance storage heavyweight DataDirect Networks (DDN) has added to its recent acquisition of virtualized all-flash \u00a0storage management vendor Tintri with this morning\u2019s announced acquisition of \u00a0software-defined storage (SDS) company Nexenta.Terms of the deal were not disclosed.While DDN originally targeted the traditional HPC world and maintains a strong presence in the Top500 list of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers, over the past five years the company has increasingly sold into commercial markets. The Nexenta acquisition is another step in that direction, broadening the company\u2019s market reach into the enterprise, AI/machine learning space. It\u2019s also another indicator that enterprise data centers are taking on the characteristics of HPC systems that require high performance networking and, in DDN\u2019s focus area, storage management fabrics (see \u201cExponential: Today and Tomorrow\u2019s Expansive AI-Big Data-HPC Landscape\u201d for a [mostly] good-natured discussion of the originator of this observation).\u201cDDN has made its mark in demanding markets where high performance and capacity scalability are extremely important, such as HPC, life sciences, media & entertainment and more recently in the artificial intelligence and machine learning space,\u201d Henry Baltazar, research VP, infrastructure, at 451 Research, told us. \u201cThe addition of Nexenta pushes DDN into the enterprise and midrange storage markets, and it also gives DDN a stronger and more complete storage portfolio, which will make it more competitive in emerging markets, such as cloud storage, persistent storage for containers, and the AI/ML space.\u201dAs of a year ago, Baltazar said, DDN had 50 customers using its gear in AI and ML for applications including natural language processing, image analysis, autonomous driving and quality control. The new division, to be called Nexenta by DDN, adds enterprise-class scale-up and scale-out software capabilities for, in DDN\u2019s words, \u201chardware-, protocol-, stack/platform-, cloud- and app-agnostic deployments\u201d along with Nexenta\u2019s 3,000 enterprise, telco and service provider customers, 300 partners, 50 patents and nearly 2,000 petabytes of storage capacity.\"Overall, the infrastructure vendors are all looking to come to market with a more complete story,\" Baltazar said, \"which is why we are seeing storage, networking and other acquisitions taking place. Everybody wants to plug holes either with M&A or partnerships.\"In an interview last week, James Coomer, DDN VP of products, said the combination of the three companies\u2019 technologies put DDN \u201cin an excellent position to build a set of services, a set of products, a wider DataDirect Networks group of companies, to serve those AI, IoT and 5g markets.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing a lot on the AI markets,\u201d he said, \u201cTintri brought us our first steps into the enterprise and they\u2019re having an extremely strong enterprise product in that virtualized space\u2026. With Nexenta, we add a third pillar\u2026. Nexenta has purely software defined services and they provide the whole range of data services that are complementary to what DDN has \u2013 so they have enterprise class NAS, NFS, SMB, provide S3 and they have block services for their products, in a pretty software-defined way\u2026. In the next couple years, we\u2019ll start to see the emergence of 5G and on the tail of 5G is going to be the realization of the IoT market, and that all falls back into AI \u2013 because AI is going to be a vital component in realizing the value of IT in delivering those high value services for all those consumers out there.\u201dWhile DDN is aimed at delivering high performance storage at companies \u201ctrying to address their most extreme data challenges in AI and HPC,\u201d Coomer said, Nexenta SDS \u201cgives us robust enterprise-class data services for telco and enterprise, so really, the overlap is very small and the complementarity is very large.\u201dIn turn, Coomer sees AI, IoT and 5G also complementing each other \u2013 with the need for solutions that support all three.\u201cIn order for IoT to be realized by all the myriad of companies that can provide IoT services,\u201d he said, \u201cthey need real time streaming analytics\u2026 (and they have a) need for AI to be embedded into that ecosystem. So that sort of holy trinity of AI, IoT and 5G is really what we think we\u2019ve got going for us moving forward: the AI heritage from DDN emerging out of our HPC heritage, and IoT and 5G is Nexenta\u2019s stronghold and strong base.\u201dIn the same pre-announcement interview, Nexenta CEO Tarkan Maner cited Nexenta customers Ericsson, Nokia and other telcos.\u201cWe support with our software-defined storage capabilities very large-scale 5G deployments,\u201d he said, \u201csupporting network virtualized functionality through the infrastructures, delivering very large-scale IoT applications for telcos in multiple companies. Out of 700 operators worldwide, we are almost in 100 of them, moving them to 5G.\u201cThe last 12 months has been a big PoC year,\u201d Maner said, \u201cnow this year in 2019, those are moving to big deployments \u2013 we are expecting hundreds of terabytes of deployments per telco, globally. So in each country, these telcos are replacing large-scale cloud, so to speak, partnering\u2026with AWS, Google and all the other cloud service providers, creating huge opportunities in the market \u2013 and Nexenta opens up those opportunities. Obviously, we do not have large-scale AI/HPC capabilities, that\u2019s where DDN comes in. So (the acquisition) creates a lot of cross-pollination and great opportunities for both companies.\u201dCoomer and Maner said Nexenta will initially remain a stand-alone business, \u201cbut at the end of the day our goal is to create cross-pollination opportunities as we move forward, geographically, vertically, and from a solutions perspective,\u201d Maner said.",
