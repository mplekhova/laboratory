    "text": "As companies consolidate storage infrastructure in public clouds, market consolidation among storage vendors continues apace as vendors offer expanded offerings designed to boost cloud access to growing data volumes.The latest example is NetApp\u2019s (NASDAQ:\u00a0NTAP) deal announced on Monday (March 9) to acquire Talon Storage, which specializes in software-defined cloud storage that among other scenarios makes data accessible to branch offices.NetApp, Sunnyvale, Calif., said the acquisition would combine its Cloud Volumes framework with Talon\u2019s software-defined storage platform designed to centralized data storage in the cloud while allowing consistent access at remote locations.The result, said Anthony Lyle, general manager of NetApp\u2019s Cloud Data Services unit, is \u201ca unified footprint of unstructured data that all users access seamlessly, regardless of where in the world they are, as if all users and data were in the same physical location.\u201dTerms of the acquisition were not disclosed.The deal for Talon would add new remote capabilities to NetApp\u2019s portfolio of\u00a0cloud data services, including its file storage service running on Microsoft Azure and other public clouds. The company notes that its Azure NetApp File service handles cloud workloads without code modification.Along with the file storage service, NetApp said Talon\u2019s storage software will be integrated with its Cloud Volumes offerings.NetApp was among the early hybrid cloud vendors to endorse the Kubernetes cluster orchestrator with its acquisition of StackPointCloud, developer of a Kubernetes cluster orchestration service for multiple clouds. The September 2018 deal gave NetApp a Kubernetes service to support the application orchestration framework of its Data Fabric platform.Among other features, that combination enabled multi-cloud application orchestration with\u00a0persistent storage\u00a0for stateful applications.The acquisitions are designed to bolster NetApp\u2019s efforts to help customers consolidate unstructured data in the cloud that can be organized in files shared across enterprises. Along with Azure, the company\u2019s file sharing service also runs on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.NetApp and Talon Storage previously partnered to create a data fabric for managing unstructured data. The platform unveiled last year incorporated Talon\u2019s software-defined data storage fabric as a way to consolidate unstructured data into an enterprise-wide directory structure visible to all users. Active data sets are cached locally to reduce latency.The file caching capability \u201cautomatically updates the active data set on the local storage volume based on actual usage patterns and typically reduces storage capacity requirements by 70 to 80 percent at the [network] edge,\u201d the partners said in a blog post describing their data storage partnership.\u201cThe future of data storage is not just in cloud storage or virtualization,\u201d added Jaap van Duijvenbode, Talon Storage\u2019s product director, in a separate post. \u201cTo future-proof data storage, an intelligent file management system is needed.\u201dGeorge Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
