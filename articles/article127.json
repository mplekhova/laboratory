    "text": "Serial entrepreneur Ben Golub, co-founder and former CEO of application container pioneer Docker Inc., has landed at a blockchain-based cloud startup called Storj Labs.The Atlanta-based company launched in 2015 is attempting to ride the wave of decentralized infrastructure fueled by blockchain technology and associated digital ledgers to offer cheap, encrypted cloud storage. Storj Labs announced Monday (March 12) that Golub will serve as its executive chairman and interim CEO.The startup\u2019s crowd-sourced approach to cloud storage challenges the prevailing hyperscale model of datacenter operators. Instead, it offers cryptocurrency to storage \u201cfarmers\u201d who rent their unused hard drive capacity as a storage layer. Storj said it has so far assembled about 150,000 storage nodes holding more than 60 petabytes of data. Individuals and organizations renting storage capacity are paid in a startup\u2019s \u201cutility token\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain.Over the last two years, Storj claims it has forged \u201cthe largest decentralized cloud storage network without ever owning a datacenter.\u201dThe addition of Golub, who is credited with making application containers a core infrastructure technology, gives Storj a measure of credibility in the evolving cloud storage sector where it claims a \u201cfirst-mover advantage\u201d in decentralized cloud storage. Before launching Docker, Golub was CEO of open source storage vendor Gluster, which was acquired by Red Hat (NYSE: RHT) in 2011.\u201cWe are making decentralized storage part of a broader decentralized stack for distributed applications by acting as a base layer storage infrastructure,\u201d Golub explained in a blog post.The startup further hopes to differentiate itself from a growing number of well-heeled storage entrants, many focusing on data-intensive workloads, by offering \u201ca new platform that will help customer[s] build and deploy decentralized apps with decentralized storage,\u201d according to Shawn Wilkinson, founder and chief strategy officer at Storj.The object storage network is built around blockchain functionality used by Storj to rent unused drive capacity from \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of individuals and organizations compensated with the startup\u2019s Ethereum-based tokens. So far, Storj claims more than 70,000 customers in the form of API registrations.Golub drew parallels between Docker\u2019s startup phase and Storj\u2019s open- source effort to use blockchain technology to build a decentralized storage layer. \u201cAt Docker, we used to talk about building a programming layer for the Internet\u2026 to build applications and services that could run and interoperate seamlessly across the millions of devices connected by the Internet,\u201d he noted.While the decentralized approach appears at first glance to be a hodgepodge, the startup insists decentralized storage is more reliable than datacenter approaches. For example, it said individual files can be distributed over dozens of nodes to prevent loss.From a security standpoint, Golub added: \u201cThere is no central location to attack, only the user knows where each of their shards are stored and all the data is encrypted.\u201dThe startup also claims its distributed approach addresses network bottlenecks by using multiple nodes to deliver files \u201csimultaneously in parallel from the edge.\u201dAll this is delivered via large and unused storage capacity rented from \u201cfarmers\u201d in exchange for cryptocurrency.Storj completed a $30 million token sale in 2016 for its ERC-20 token that can be used on the storage network to purchase services. The more than 150,000 storage nodes assembled thus far cover 205 countries and territories, the startup said.George Leopold has written about science and technology for more than 30 years, focusing on electronics and aerospace technology.
