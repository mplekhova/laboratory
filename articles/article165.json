    "title": "Why Immutability Should Be a Standard Feature in Cloud Storage",
    "text": "Data is the new gold in our digital society, and the loss of it can cause panic or serious consequences. Recently, I saw an article about the Oakland, CA, police department losing 25 percent of its body cam videos due to someone pushing the wrong button and\u00a0accidentally deleting files during a software upgrade.The Oakland example is about human error, but who can forget the\u00a0WannaCry ransomware attack and compromised data returned for a fee? Scary for certain, and all too common, but easily\u00a0preventable with something new to disk-based storage called \u201cimmutable buckets.\u201d\u201cImmutability\u201d means that data, once written, cannot be deleted or altered for a pre-determined length of time \u2013 or in some\u00a0cases, forever. It\u2019s the protection of content from accidental or malicious destruction or alteration.Immutability is by no means a\u00a0new concept in security. Paper documents signed in pen and ink and locked away in secure vaults is conceptually similar and has long been the gold\u00a0standard in the legal world. In the digital world, IT folks make backup tapes and store them in bank vaults or\u00a0secure warehouses. While taking media off-line and storing it in a bunker is a good way to protect it from accidental erasure or from being overwritten, it also makes the data so difficult to retrieve that it\u2019s almost useless.In the last few years, developments in encryption and security technology have made it possible to create immutable storage\u00a0from ordinary computer disk drives. Here\u2019s how it works: when you create a storage bucket (similar to a folder in the PC world),\u00a0you can flip a switch and make that bucket immutable, meaning any data stored in that bucket cannot be erased or modified for\u00a0some pre-determined length of time \u2013 a highly desirable feature that should be baked into any data storage option.Why is this a huge improvement in data security? Most people in the IT world worry about equipment failure as the likely\u00a0cause of data loss. This used to be a real problem, but not so much anymore. Loss from equipment\u00a0failure is called \u201cdurability,\u201d and it is usually expressed in \u201cnines\u201d, e.g., 99.999 percent, or \u201cfive nines.\u201d Amazon S3, for example, has 11\u00a0nines of durability. In other words, if you stored a million one-megabyte files with Amazon, statistically you might lose one file\u00a0every 659,000 years. There is so much redundancy built into these systems that actually losing a file almost never happens.\u00a0People obsessing over the durability of this or that storage system are barking up the wrong tree.My years at Carbonite (a company I founded) taught me that\u00a0even the best run shops\u00a0lose data every day \u2013 but most of it is due\u00a0to 1) human error, 2) malware and ransomware, 3) bugs in application software that accidently overwrite or delete data, and 4)\u00a0employee or insider sabotage. However, if you store data in immutable buckets, all of those risks disappear. If you try to delete or\u00a0modify data stored in an immutable bucket, you just get an error message. The WannaCry virus would have zero impact on\u00a0immutable data.So, what\u2019s the downside of immutability? \u00a0Well, if you can\u2019t erase data, it means you\u2019re stuck paying for the storage even if you\u00a0no longer need the data. Before you put data into an immutable bucket, you need to reconcile yourself with the value of doing so.\u00a0As the cost of immutable data storage drops, the cost/benefit equation shifts dramatically. Even if you can\u2019t clean up data that is\u00a0stored in immutable buckets, who cares if it\u2019s super cheap? It\u2019s probably not worth the effort even if you could get rid of data that\u00a0you no longer need.Some data are so valuable that immutability is a no-brainer. For example,\u00a0the movie Avatar cost $237 million to produce. In the end,\u00a0all you have to show for it is about a petabyte of data. That\u2019s a valuable data set and you\u2019re probably never going to throw it away. If you\u00a0had the option of storing it immutably so that some overworked IT person couldn\u2019t mistakenly push the wrong button and destroy it, it would be a no-brainer.Here\u2019s another example, the LSST telescope in Chile goes online next year.\u00a0The telescope itself cost over $1 billion to construct and\u00a0all you have to show for it will be roughly 18 terabytes of data every night that will be mined by astronomers for decades to come. \u00a0If you\u00a0lose that data, you\u2019ve essentially lost a big chunk of that billion dollars. \u00a0Why take a chance with accidents, malware, sabotage, hardware\u00a0failures, etc.?\u00a0In cases like these, immutability would still be a bargain.I feel this way about the videos of my kids when they were\u00a0growing up. I\u2019d gladly pay to have them stored in an immutable bucket if it really meant that I couldn\u2019t accidentally delete them.Making electronic data immutable has been something of an afterthought until recently. But with massive growth in data, and\u00a0the risk of another global ransomware attack looming, I believe that immutable storage must become a standard feature in cloud\u00a0storage. And as prices drop, the case for immutability becomes even more compelling.David Friend is CEO of Wasabi.",
